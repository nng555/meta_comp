Where Ukrainian Children Once Played, Piles of Toys Memorialize the DeadA Russian missile strike near a playground in central Ukraine killed 19 people, including nine children. The attack was a painful reminder that a cease-fire remains as distant as ever. Their lives intersected around a playground on a sunny Friday evening in Kryvyi Rih, a city in central Ukraine. Kostiantyn Novik, 16, had come with his cousin to hang out with friends. Serhii Smotolok, a 57-year-old welder, was nursing a beer nearby on the terrace of a restaurant, unwinding after his workday. Radislav Yatsko, 7, was sitting in the back seat of his parents’ car as they drove past the playground, headed home from an afternoon at their country cottage. In an instant, the lively scene turned to carnage: A Russian missile struck near the playground, raining shrapnel that tore apart everything in its path. Kostiantyn and his cousin were killed instantly, Kostiantyn’s leg torn off by the blast. Mr. Smotolok was struck by missile fragments and bled to death on the terrace. Radislav died as shrapnel blew off part of his skull. “Everything was covered in blood,” said his father, Rodion Yatsko. He begged the medics who arrived shortly after to save his son’s life. “Then one man came to our car, looked inside and said, ‘It’s over.’”Radislav Yatsko, who was killed when Russia struck near a playground in Ukraine. Theattack last Friday killed 19 civilians, including nine children, making it the deadliest strike against children since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion,according to the United Nations. The assault, the worst on Kryvyi Rih during the war, sent shock waves across Ukraine, whichdeclared a day of national mourning on Sunday. Western allies expressed their solidarity, with embassies in Kyiv lowering their flags to half-staff that day. For residents of Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, the attack was a painful reminder that after three years the war is still grinding on, despiteongoing cease-fire negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Moscow continues to send volleys of missiles and drones into Ukrainian cities far from the front lines, despite the risk to civilians. Russia’s defense ministryclaimedthat the strike had killed 85 Ukrainian and Western military officers gathered at the restaurant near the playground. But security footage reviewed by The New York Times showed that the restaurant had been filled with women attending a beauty industry event, and employees were cleaning up the room just minutes before the attack. “They simply murder children and civilians,” Anna Yatsko, Radislav’s mother, said on Sunday, on the eve of her son’s funeral. “There were no soldiers, only civilians.”“All the talks about a cease-fire are just empty words,” she added. Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city of 600,000 about 40 miles from the front lines, has been struck regularly by Russian drones and missiles. Two days before Friday’s strike, a missile killed four residents. Amid the hardship, residents yearn for moments of joy. When 16-year-old Kostiantyn asked his aunt and legal guardian, Liubov Svoroba, if he and his cousin could hang out with friends at the playground, she hesitated but eventually agreed. The two teenagers enjoyed escaping the shadows of war there, often working out on rudimentary, colorful sit-up benches and chest-press machines scattered across the sandy terrain. “They said they just wanted to go for a walk and see their friends,” Ms. Svoroba, 65, said. “As soon as they got there, the explosion happened.”Serhii Smotolok was nursing a beer on the terrace of a nearby restaurant when the missile struck. From her apartment a few blocks away, Olga Yaroshenko, 66, saw a huge plume of smoke and dust rising from the playground. Her first thought was of her partner, Mr. Smotolok, the welder who was drinking beer at the restaurant. They had been together for eight years, finding love later in life. They were saving money for a new car — Mr. Smotolok’s dream. As Ms. Yaroshenko rushed to the strike site, she saw the bodies of a woman, a teenager and several children, some already covered with blankets by medics. “The whole area looked like a field of corpses,” she recalled. “There were cries, screams — it was unbearable.”In the chaos, she could not find Mr. Smotolok and clung to the hope that he had made it out safely. Then her phone rang, his number flashing on the screen. “I felt relief — ‘He must be alive!’” she recalled thinking. Olga Yaroshenko, Mr. Smotolok’s partner, rushed to scene of the strike after seeing a huge plume of smoke. “There were cries, screams — it was unbearable,” she said. She answered the phone, only to hear a stranger’s voice: “This is the investigator speaking. Serhii Heorihiyovych died today,” a police officer told her, using her partner’s patronymic. On Sunday, the area around the playground still bore scars of the carnage: bloodstains on the pavement, a piece of human flesh on a restaurant chair. Nearby buildings had shattered windows, and a deep crater created by the missile’s impact gaped a few yards from the playground. It remains unclear exactly what type of weapon Russia fired at the park. The United Nations, which sent a team to inspect the area, and the local authorities believe that Russia used an Iskander ballistic missile that exploded several meters above the park, showering the area with shrapnel. Mr. Yatsko, Radislav’s father, said their family was so inseparable that he used to think if a missile or drone ever struck, they would all die together. At least, he said, “no one would suffer” the pain of losing a loved one. The crater left by the missile, next to the playground. But on Friday, only Radislav was killed. His parents, his 8-month-old sister, Adelina, and his great-grandmother — all of whom were in the car when the missile struck — survived with concussions and scratches. Ms. Yatsko had given birth to Radislav after struggling for years to get pregnant. When he arrived, she said, he “made everything so much better.”He loved animals, spending hours at the family’s cottage collecting cockroaches, lizards and butterflies, when he was not rescuing hedgehogs from busy streets. At a school memorial on Monday, one of his teachers said she had never heard a boy speak with such tenderness about his little sister. When Ms. Yatsko was pregnant with Adelina, she said, Radislav would kiss her belly every night before bed. Rodion Yatsko, center, and his wife, Anna Yatsko, at the funeral of their son, Radislav. At his funeral on Monday, Ms. Yatsko, wearing a black bandanna to represent her mourning, gazed at her son’s face as he was carried in an open coffin into a small wooden Orthodox Christian church. A gray hat concealed his head injury. A red scar running from his forehead to his bruised right eye was the only sign of trauma. “It’s not him! It’s not him!” Ms. Yatsko cried, then muttered Radislav’s name three times, as if trying to wake him from a long sleep. Before burying him, his parents tucked a plush animal between his arms. In the days after the attack, makeshift memorials sprang up across the park, with stuffed toys, candy bars, roses and candles covering benches, swings and teeter-totters where some of the children died. By Monday evening, the largest pile, nearly chest high, stood in the center of the playground, concealing a merry-go-round. Ms. Yatsko said she longed for a life where children could run and play freely. “But for now,” she said, “even a children’s playground is not safe.”The playground on Sunday.

Reporting from GenevaGuterres, at U.N., Denounces Israel’s Gaza Aid Blockade“The floodgates of horror” have been opened for Palestinians since the collapse of the temporary cease-fire, Secretary General António Guterres said. The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, on Tuesday sharply criticized Israel’s renewed blockade of aid to Gaza as a violation of its obligations under international law and said it had opened “the floodgates of horror.”“Gaza is a killing field and civilians are in an endless death loop,” Mr. Guterres said in prepared remarks to journalists at United Nations headquarters in New York. “More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza,” he said. “No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened.”It was some of the secretary general’s strongest language about Israel since the country’s war with Hamas began. His words reflected what senior U.N. officials say is a mounting sense of desperation over the failure of the international community — including Israel’s closest ally, the United States — to constrain Israel’s military conduct in Gaza. The Israeli government rejected Mr. Guterres’s criticisms. “As always, you don’t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,” the spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Oren Marmorstein,said on social media. “There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip — over 25,000 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip in the 42 days of the cease-fire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza.”As an occupying power in Gaza, Mr. Guterres said, Israel has “inescapable obligations” under the Geneva Conventions to ensure delivery of food and medicine and to maintain hospitals and public health services. “None of that is happening today,” he said. And new aid delivery mechanisms proposed by Israel, Mr. Guterres said, risk “further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour,” he said. The U.N. will not participate in any arrangement that does not respect basic humanitarian principles of independence and neutrality, he said. He also said that assertions that Gaza had enough food to feed its entire population were far from the reality on the ground, where commodities are running extremely low. “The current path is a dead end — totally intolerable in the eyes of international law and history,” Mr. Guterres said. A day after meeting with the families of Israelis taken hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that set off the war, Mr. Guterres also called for the hostages’ immediate and unconditional release. “I condemned Hamas for their brutal kidnapping and horrible treatment,” he. Jabaliya on Tuesday. U.N. officials say basic provisions are in short supply. The meeting with the families took place the same day that the heads of the U.N.’s six biggest aid agencies issued a rare joint statement. “We are witnessing acts of war in Gaza that show an utter disregard for human life,” it said. In just the first week after the cease-fire broke down, more than a thousand children were reported killed or injured in Gaza, said the agency chiefs, including those responsible for food, children, health and humanitarian aid. It was the highest one-week death toll for children there of the past year, they said. The statement was issued amid international calls for an independent investigation into the deaths of 15 Palestinian Red Crescent staff members and aid workersshot by Israeli forceslast month in an attack that U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk, said added to concerns over the commission of war crimes by the Israeli military. The International Criminal Court has already issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and for a Hamas leader, accusing them of war crimes, thoughMr. Netanyahuhas been traveling abroad over the past week anyway. On Monday, he met with President Trump at the White House. On Tuesday, the U.N. humanitarian aid coordinator, Tom Fletcher, chided the Security Council for doing too little to protect civilians and uphold international law, pointing to the conflicts not just in Gaza but also Ukraine, Sudan and Myanmar. “Not only are we not standing robustly for international law, but in some cases we are supporting its debasement,” Mr. Fletcher said. “That’s the common thread that links these conflicts.”Johnatan Reisscontributed reporting.

Reporting from Dakar, SenegalDozens Die in Floods Hitting Congo’s CapitalWhile the Democratic Republic of Congo reels from a new rebel offensive in the east, its capital in the west, Kinshasa,  grapples with deadly floods. Dozens of people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo after torrential rains flooded the capital, Kinshasa, in the last few days, and destroyed hundreds of homes. The Ndjili River running through the megacity of 17 million people, one of the largest on the continent, burst its banks and submerged major roads, including Lumumba Boulevard, the main road leading to the airport. Government officials said thousands of people have been displaced and at least 33 had been killed, though they warned that the death toll would likely rise as the floods recede. Lumumba Boulevard on Sunday. Lumumba Boulevard on Monday. Many African countries are facing frequent, deadly floods and droughts, which scientists attribute to climate change. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the second largest country in Africa, hundreds of people have died annually in recent years as a result of severe rains and flooding. In 2024, Congo faced its worst floodingin six decades, according to Unicef and other United Nations agencies. More than 300 people died, and 280,000 households were displaced. In 2023, more than 400 people died in floods; in 2022, rains and floods killed more than 160. A man lies on top of a car for safety as floodwaters inundate a road following heavy rains in the Ndjili district of Kinshasa on Sunday. President Felix Tshisekedi visited the flooded areas on Saturday and promised food supplies and a safe return for those who were displaced. He blamed the high death toll on the illegal settlements that dot the city. Kinshasa’s rapid, largely unplanned growth has resulted in widespread construction on vulnerable hillsides, which lack effective drainage systems. “We just managed to save our lives,” said Denise Sukali, 45, who has been sheltering in a church since Saturday with her children. “I’m safe with all my family, but my house is under water.”Congo, a country of more than 100 million people, is already reeling from one of the most severe humanitarian crises in Africa. A 30-year-old conflict in its eastern regions has reignited since the beginning of the year, killing thousands and displacing nearly seven million people. One of the biggest humanitarian programs in the world in 2024 was in Congo, where the United States spent $910 million on food, water, sanitation and shelter for displaced people, according to the United Nations’ Bureau for Humanitarian Affairs. After the United States ended most of its foreign assistance to the continent this year, about 7.8 million people stand to lose food aid, and 2.3 million children risk malnutrition.

Will Retaliation Work for Europe? It’s a Gamble.,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/europe-trump-tariff-retaliation.html,2025-04-08T16:23:35Z,World,"Europe wants to negotiate, but it is also trying to project strength.

Reporting from BrusselsWill Retaliation Work for Europe? It’s a Gamble. Europe wants to negotiate, but it is also trying to project strength. As Trump warns nations against retaliation, that strategy could be perilous. The European Union is responding to President Trump’s sweeping trade war with a handshake and a punch: It is promising the administration potential wins while also preparing its own retaliatory tariffs on American products starting next week. The questions are whether the enticements are enough, and whether a show of strength could backfire. “Europe can hurt America, and retaliating seems like a good strategy if you believe that Trump cares about the political fallout from economic pain here at home,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, in Washington. “The worry is that he doesn’t care.”Mr. Trump has threatened to impose huge additional tariffs on Chinese goods to punish the nation for retaliating against his previous tariffs, and his team appears to be giving some nations that did not retaliate and have close economic ties to the U.S. —notably Japan— priority in negotiations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has yet to grab the carrots that Europe has dangled in front of him. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, offered on Monday to drop tariffs on imported American cars and other industrial products to zero if the U.S. does the same, a “zero-for-zero” strategy. Asked about that possibility, Mr. Trump said “it’s not” enough to make him back down. Instead, the administration appears to be standing by its spate of recently-announced tariffs, at least for now. The Trump administration has announced 20 percent across-the-board levies on the E.U., in addition to even higher ones on steel, aluminum and cars. Against that backdrop, representatives from across the European Union are expected to vote on Wednesday on a set of retaliatory tariffs that would respond to U.S. steel and aluminum levies. If approved, those counter-tariffs would take hold in phases starting in mid-April, in the bloc’s first attempt at throwing around its economic weight, betting it can prod American officials toward a deal. President Trump announced a sweeping list of tariffs at the White House last week. The European Union is the United States’ most important trading partnerby some measures, when its 27 nations are taken as a whole. But so far, Mr. Trump has expressed a willingness to accept short-term economic suffering in exchange for a long-term reordering of the global trading system. “Trump has made it clear that any pain to the U.S. economy caused by targeted tariffs will not serve as a deterrent to an escalation of tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist focused on international trade at Cornell University. “So there is no clear off ramp.”European officials are conscious that a tit-for-tat trade war would also cost the continent’s businesses and consumers. And since Europe sells more goods to the United States than it purchases in return, the bloc lacks the upper hand, particularly when it comes to physical products: If it responds to every tariff with a counter-tariff, it will simply run out of imports to put penalties on. That is why Europe is taking its slow and multipronged approach — moving gradually and in stages to roll out goods tariffs, threatening the possibility of hitting American services like big technology companies, and hoping that America comes to the table before the retaliation fully takes hold. “We’re trying to avoid tariffs,” Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “Our response is phased, calm, calibrated, and targeted.”In many ways, Europe is gambling on time. If it moves gradually, it is possible that plummeting stock prices will dim the American appetite for a trade war. The markets are down sharply over the past week, a painful blow to American retirement accounts and investment nest eggs. Falling markets could dim domestic support for tariffs in the United States. “We’re waiting for our American counterparts to engage in a meaningful way,” Mr. Gill said. Mr. Trump suggested late on Monday that he might be willing to strike a deal with Europe — if it eliminates its trade imbalance with the United States. He said it could do so by vastly expanding oil and gas purchases to $350 billion, the number he claims for the trade deficit with the European Union. That would be an immense increase in how much U.S. energy Europe buys, which Goldman Sachs estimates was about 63.5 billion euros, more than $69 billion, last year. Most estimates put the U.S. trade imbalance much lower than Mr. Trump does, and the European Union’s own measure places it atabout $171 billion just for goods. The deficit shrinks to $52 billion when counting services, since the United States sells Europe more internet and technology services in particular than it buys from the bloc. European leaders have suggested a willingness to buy more American fuel, but such big liquid natural gas purchases would be difficult to promise, if not impossible, a number of analysts said. Among other issues, gas purchases are driven by demand in the market, not just political decisions. A liquefied gas plant in Port Arthur, Tex., in February. Mr. Trump has suggested that he might be willing to strike a deal with Europe on tariffs if it expands oil and gas purchases from the United States. Plus, “Europe will not want to replace its old total dependence on Russian natural gas with total dependence on” American liquid natural gas, said Krishna Guha at Evercore ISI. Also on Monday, Mr. Trump expressed comfort with leaving at least some of the tariffs on long-term — bad news for Europeans who have been hoping for a rapid, negotiated solution. That lack of progress is why Europe is getting ready to hit back. European officials have spent weeks vetting the list of tariffs that are up for a vote on Wednesday, trying to make sure the list would not unduly hurt European firms or customers. The size of the list was trimmed during that process, and products likebourbon are expectedto be dropped; America had threatened to hit European alcohol witha 200 percenttariff if bourbon remained in the cross hairs. But there are serious questions about whether Europe will come to regret moving ahead with retaliation. China’s decision to hit back prompted Mr. Trump’s threat to subject Chinese imports to a staggering 104 percent tariff. On social media, Mr. Trumpblamed Chinafor responding “despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs.”As European officials try to figure out exactly what America wants, and what could lead to a deal, the steel and aluminum counter-tariffs that could take hold next week would be just the first move in their own retaliation. Mr. Gill, the European Commission spokesman, suggested on Tuesday that proposed countermeasures for the 20 percent tariff on E.U. goods that Mr. Trump announced on April 2 could come as soon as next week. European officials are also talking about whether to use a new trade weapon to hit big American technology companies with trade barriers. But the risk is that such threats will fall on deaf ears, because Mr. Trump’s goal is to rewire the global trading system — and because this is his second term as president, which could make him less worried about slipping political support at home. “There’s a lot of risk around that strategy,” Mr. Strain said.

Putin of Russia was not truly interested in peace. “Russia’s involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” he wrote on social media. Mr. Zelensky said that he had instructed his foreign minister to “immediately contact Beijing and clarify how China intends to respond to this.” The foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, confirmed that he had summoned the Chinese chargé d’affaires to demand an explanation. “Chinese citizens fighting as part of Russia’s invasion army in Ukraine puts into question China’s declared stance for peace,” Mr. Sybiha wrote on social media. Both Russia and Ukraine have had foreign fighters in their ranks throughout the more than three years of war. In most cases they are foreign volunteers or mercenaries, though Russia’s military hasenlisted the help of North Korean soldiers. The presence of Chinese nationals on the front lines in Ukraine has never been reported in Chinese state media. However, there have been unverified reports on social media in China of mercenaries from the country fighting in Ukraine. While China hasclaimed neutralityin the war, Beijing has provided the Kremlin with both diplomatic and economic backing during the conflict, support that the Biden administration said allowed Russia to sustain its offensive. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with Xi Jinping of China last year. While China has claimed neutrality in the war in Ukraine, Beijing has provided the Kremlin with both diplomatic and economic support. China purchases huge quantities of Russian oil and supplies Moscow with technologies that can be used on the battlefield, such as drones. Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, and Mr. Putin have met numerous times and deepened their countries’ ties to include more military cooperation. Mr. Zelensky’s announcement about the Chinese fighters came hours after he confirmed for the first time that Ukrainian forces were operating in the Belgorod region of Russia. The New York Times reported last month that Ukrainian troops had been makinga new cross-border push, into Belgorod, after being driven out of the Kursk region. Military analysts said that the aim of the operation might be to divert Russian forces away from Kursk — where Ukraine’s troops lostnearly all of the territoryseized in across-border offensivelast summer — or to gain a new patch of land that could serve as leverage in peace negotiations. In his nightly address on Monday, Mr. Zelensky said that military operations in Kursk and Belgorod were aimed at protecting Ukrainian regions on the other side of the border.

Pilots Discussed Alternate Ways to Land Before Deadly Jeju Air Crash,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/asia/jeju-crash-communications.html,2025-04-08T14:34:37Z,World,"The pilots’ conversation with air traffic controllers, revealed in a partial transcript, could offer clues to what caused the disaster in South Korea, which killed 179 people.","Jeju Air Flight 2216; Aviation Accidents, Safety and Disasters; Airlines and Airplanes; Air Traffic Control; Pilots",,South Korea,Jeju Air Co Ltd; Muan International Airport,"Jeju Air Flight 2216 crashed at Muan International Airport in South Korea on Dec. 29. Grace Moon reported from Seoul. Pilots Discussed Alternate Ways to Land Before Deadly Jeju Air CrashThe pilots’ conversation with air traffic controllers, revealed in a partial transcript, could offer clues to what caused the disaster in South Korea, which killed 179 people. The pilots of Jeju Air Flight 2216 signaled three different plans for landing the stricken plane in the minutes before it crashed and killed 179 people in December, according to a partial transcript of their communication with air traffic controllers obtained by The New York Times. The transcript shows that the pilots reported a bird strike and radioed a mayday call as they approached Muan International Airport in South Korea on the morning of Dec. 29. They said they would turn left, then asked to turn right, intending to approach the airport’s sole runway from the south. When that failed, air traffic controllers asked if they wanted to land from the opposite direction, and the pilots said yes. The planelanded on its belly, overran the runway and struck a concrete structure that housed navigation aids, bursting into a deadly fireball. Only two people — flight attendants at the very back of the plane, a Boeing 737-800 — survived. The cause of the disaster, the deadliest plane crash on South Korean soil, is still being investigated, and the exchange between the pilots and the control tower could be a crucial piece of the puzzle. That is because it covers a period of about four minutes during which both of the plane’s flight recorders, known as black boxes, had stopped recording. The transcript includes no information about the state of the jet’s two engines or its electrical supply, which are intense areas of focus for investigators. It is still unclear why the black boxes went dark or why the plane’s landing gear was not engaged. The transcript was read out on Saturday torelatives of the victimsby a representative of a board that is investigating the crash. The official told them that the readout excluded parts of the conversation to protect the privacy of its participants, according to people who shared it with The Times. Officials have not publicly released the transcript, and the board did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Multiple investigations, including one by the police, are underway in South Korea into the cause of the accident and factors that might have made it deadlier, like the solid concrete structure at the end of the runway. American and French investigators are assisting in one of the investigations. Relatives of people who were on the plane waited for news at the airport. Only two people survived the crash. Much of what happened on that December morning remains a mystery. As the plane, which took off from Bangkok, approached Muan in southwestern South Korea, it began its descent, reaching an altitude of about 700 feet before running into trouble. First came a warning: Air traffic controllers told the pilots to be cautious because there were birds in the area. About a minute later, both of the plane’s black boxes — its flight data recorder and its cockpit voice recorder — stopped recording. That outage has complicated the investigation. But videos shot by onlookers, a preliminary accident report issued by the Korean authorities, and now the transcript of the pilots’ exchange with the control tower provide some clues. This is what we know: Around 8:58 a.m., the pilots reported a bird strike to the tower and declared their intention to turn around. “Mayday, mayday,” one of the pilots said. “Going around.”Authorities later found feathers and blood from migratory ducks known as baikal teals in both of the jet’s engines. Eyewitness videos also recorded a loud bang from the plane’s right engine, which aviation experts have described as a compressor stall or a disruption in the engine’s airflow. Memorials to the victims at the airport. After the mayday call, the control tower told the pilots to “maintain runway heading” and climb to 5,000 feet. The pilots agreed. That is standard procedure when an aircraft is unable to land, according to Hyoseok Chang, an assistant professor in the department of air transportation and logistics at Hanseo University in South Korea. In such procedures, the aircraft climbs to a safe altitude and waits in a holding pattern. But seconds after the pilots agreed to that plan, before the airplane could reach 5,000 feet, the control tower pressed them to state their intention. They answered that they would make a left turn and land shortly on Runway 1. (That is professional terminology for approaching the airport’s single runway from the south; Runway 19 refers to approaching it from the north.)The pilots may have determined that “returning all the way to the holding point and attempting another approach to Runway 1 could cause further issues with the aircraft,” Professor Chang said. The compressor stall observed in videos indicates that there was a problem with at least one of the jet’s engines. Ten seconds later, the pilots reported that they were unable to land. They asked whether they could “make a right turn and head to Runway 1,” and the tower gave them permission to do so. The transcript does not explain why this attempt failed, too. But at just after 9:01 a.m., air traffic controllers asked whether the pilots wanted to approach the runway from the north. “Do you wish to land on Runway 19?” the controllers asked. The pilots said yes, and the tower cleared them to land. Less than two minutes later, the plane hit the tarmac without its landing gear deployed. It skidded past the end of the runway, slammed into the concrete structure and burst into flames. It is not clear what the air traffic controllers or the pilots knew about the concrete structure, which housed what is known as an instrument landing system. Under international safety standards, such structures are supposed to be built to collapse on impact, but this one was not. Agnes Changcontributed reporting.

"Is Being Royal a Job? This Prince Says Yes, and He Wants a Pension.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/belgium-prince-social-security-benefits-ruling.html,2025-04-08T14:13:46Z,World,A court case by the Belgian king’s younger brother argued that he was entitled to a state pension to keep his wife and adult children financially safe.,Royal Families; Pensions and Retirement Plans,"Laurent, Prince of Belgium",Belgium,,"Prince Laurent of Belgium at a parade in Brussels in July. Reporting from LondonIs Being Royal a Job? This Prince Says Yes, and He Wants a Pension. A court case by the Belgian king’s younger brother argued that he was entitled to a state pension to keep his wife and adult children financially safe. For attending galas, cutting ribbons and meeting diplomats, a Belgian prince takes home a royal allowance of 100,000 euros, nearly $110,000, a year. But what will happen when he stops working? For that, Prince Laurent of Belgium is seeking government benefits. A court this week agreed in part, recommending that the country’s lawmakers consider drawing up regulations for a federal pension for the prince, even as it dismissed his argument that his royal duties were in essence a job and that his incurred expenses were comparable to being self-employed. His lawyer, Olivier Rijckaert, said in an interview Tuesday that the court had effectively placed the prince in a special category, akin to a “super public servant.” Only one other person is in that category, his lawyer said: the prince’s older sister, Princess Astrid. The prince, who is 61, will now decide whether to wait for the law to be passed or to challenge the court’s ruling, hoping to speed the process, his lawyer said. Prince Laurent, the younger brother of King Phillippe, brought the case in 2023, suing Belgium’s National Institute for the Social Security of the Self-employed. He argued in court that without a pension, his wife, Princess Claire, and their three adult children would be left financially vulnerable upon his death or if he halted his duties, according to court documents. The prince receives a stipend of €400,000 a year, three-quarters of which is used to cover his staff’s salaries plus various trips and entertainment expenses, according to his lawyer. Prince Laurent is required to provide supporting documents for all of those expenses, Mr. Rijckaert said. That leaves the prince with what amounts to a salary of €100,000, the lawyer said, reduced to roughly €60,000 a year — about $65,000 — after tax. (In Belgium, the average household disposable income is $34,884 a year,according to datafrom the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.)The case hasset off a debatein some corners of Belgium on whether royal duties count as work, an argument that Mr. Rijckaertoutlined in an opinion piece last year, asserting that his client should be entitled to social security. “If you think that cutting ribbons, shaking hands and listening to people at length while showing interest (real or feigned) in their activities is not work, give it a few days,” the lawyer wrote. The prince’s net income, Mr. Rijckaert argued, corresponds to that of a senior executive in Belgium. But “the difference is that the senior executive benefits, in addition to this salary, from full social security coverage,” he wrote. “Not the prince, nor his family.”The court bid was the latest in a string of spectacles that have earned Prince Laurent the nickname “the prince maudit” — “the cursed prince.”In 2011, herisked losinghis annual stipend when he traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and met with then-President Joseph Kabila without diplomatic oversight. In the same year, heorchestrated an off-the-books meetingwith Libyan opposition officials while Muammar el-Qaddafi was in power. And in 2018, Belgium’s Parliament voted to cut his annual endowment 15 percent aspunishment for his attending an unsanctioned celebrationat the Chinese Embassy in full naval uniform. The prince, patron of charities that focus on the environment and animal welfare, has also been convicted ofspeedingand of driving anunregistered vintage car, an offense for which he was fined €200 in 2022.

"Some Israelis Favor Attacking Iran, Expressing Skepticism About Talks",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-iran-reaction.html,2025-04-08T12:14:39Z,World,Many Israelis were surprised when President Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Tehran in an effort to rein in its nuclear program.,International Relations; Iran-Israel Proxy Conflict; Nuclear Weapons,"Netanyahu, Benjamin; Trump, Donald J",Israel; Iran,,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Trump in the Oval Office on Monday. Reporting from JerusalemSome Israelis Favor Attacking Iran, Expressing Skepticism About TalksMany Israelis were surprised when President Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Tehran in an effort to rein in its nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in the past listed the three main threats facing Israel as “Iran, Iran and Iran.” He has largely staked his career on being Israel’s protector againstIranian nuclear ambitions, has openlyconfronted Tehranin recent months and is at war withIran-backed militias around the region. Many Israelis were therefore surprised when President Trump, with Mr. Netanyahu sitting beside him, announced on Monday that the United Stateswould engage in “direct” negotiationswith Iran on Saturday in a last-ditch effort to rein in the country’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump’s statement was splashed over thefront pagesof Israel’s major newspapers on Tuesday morning. As the day went on, pundits increasingly weighed in, parsing the pros and cons of the unexpected development. By early evening in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu had issued a video statement before his departure from Washington in which he largely strove to emphasize his close alliance and alignment with the Trump administration. “We agree that Iran will not have nuclear weapons,” he said, adding that this could be achieved by diplomatic accord. But a negotiated solution, he explained, would have to result in the total destruction of Iran’s vast nuclear program, blowing up facilities and dismantling all equipment, all carried out by the United States. But should Iran drag out the talks, Mr. Netanyahu said, the second option would be a military one. “Everyone understands that,” he said, adding, “We discussed it at length.”With Iran’s nuclear program considered to beat its most advanced stageever, some Israeli experts have suggested that now would be the perfect time to attack Tehran’s nuclear facilities. Iran’s traditional allies on Israel’s borders are either weakened, in the case of Hezbollah in Lebanon; or fallen, in the case ofthe Assad regimein Syria. That means any attack could take advantage of Tehran’s vulnerability afterIsraeli strikes in the falltook out air defenses around key nuclear sites. If direct talks take place, they would be the first official face-to-face negotiations between the two countries since Mr. Trumpabandoned the Obama-era nuclear accordseven years ago at the urging of Mr. Netanyahu, who had denounced it as a “bad deal.”Mr. Netanyahu said in the Oval Office on Monday that if Iran could be absolutely prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon by diplomatic means, “that would be a good thing.”Many Israelis would agree. “The ideal for Israel would be a very good agreement,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher and head of the Gulf program at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. He said he hoped Mr. Trump’s approach would be “more aggressive” than that of previous administrations in dealings with Iran. “But there is nothing ideal in the world,” Mr. Guzansky added, expressing broadly held concerns that Mr. Trump “may be willing to be more flexible than Israel would be” and that a gap may open up over the issue between Israel and Washington. The interests of the two sides already differ, Mr. Guzansky said, in that Israel sits near Iran and has to live with its proxies on its borders, while the United States is thousands of miles away and has other pressing problems. He said he hoped that Mr. Netanyahu would continue to have the ear of the Trump administration and that Israel would be kept in the picture. Some Israeli analysts were banking on any such talks failing, noting that the Iranians were tough negotiators. Many took consolation in Mr. Trump’s pronouncement that Tehran would be “in great danger” if it failed to reach an accord and pointed to reports of the Pentagon’s recent deployment of at least six B-2 bombers to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia as concrete evidence of a military option against Iran. “There is no chance the ayatollahs will agree to dictates,” Ariel Kahana, a diplomatic commentator for Israel Hayom, a right-wing daily, wrote on Tuesday, anticipating the Trump administration’s imposition of tough conditions on Iran for an agreement. “Therefore,” Mr. Kahana continued, “a military clash with Iran is only a matter of time.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

An Explosive Clock Is Ticking on Iran and Its Nuclear Program,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html,2025-04-08T11:59:23Z,World,"Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last, opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and avoid war.",United States International Relations; Nuclear Weapons; Arms Control and Limitation and Disarmament; Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,"Khamenei, Ali; Netanyahu, Benjamin; Trump, Donald J",Iran; Israel; Middle East,International Atomic Energy Agency; United Nations,"A poster in Tehran in November of Iranian scientists. President Trump said that the United States would hold talks with Iran on Saturday in an effort to rein in the country’s nuclear program. Steven Erlanger has covered talks on Iran’s nuclear program for many years and reported from Berlin. An Explosive Clock Is Ticking on Iran and Its Nuclear ProgramNews AnalysisExpected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last, opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and avoid war. Talks between the United States and Iran, which President Trump said on Mondaywould begin on Saturdayin Oman, face considerable problems of substance and well-earned mistrust. But time is short for what is likely to be a complicated negotiation. “We’re at a fork in the road, heading toward a crisis,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House. While Mr. Trump has recently threatened Iran with “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,” he has also made it clear that he prefers a diplomatic deal. That reassurance — made in the Oval Office sitting next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has pressed for military action — will be welcomed widely in the Arab world. Even if the target is the Islamic Republic of Iran, with all of its ambitions for regional hegemony, Arab countries from Egypt through the Gulf fear the economic and social consequences of an American and Israeli war, especially as the killing in Gaza continues. But Mr. Trump’s public demands — that Iran stop nuclear enrichment, hand over its large supply of enriched uranium and destroy its existing nuclear facilities — will almost surely be rejected by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, as an unacceptable humiliation and surrender. How far both sides are willing to compromise is unclear, but Mr. Trump is well known for making ultimate demands at the start and then searching for a deal. This weekend’s talks are expected to be at a high level and include Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, and reportedly Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, Russia and much else. While the two sides disagree on whether these initial talks will be “direct,” as Mr. Trump said, or “indirect” through intermediaries, as Iran said, it will not matter very much, given the importance of the two men. Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, last month. He is expected to be involved in upcoming talks. What will matter, as Mr. Araghchi said, is that the effort is “as much an opportunity as it is a test” — a test of the willingness of both sides to negotiate seriously on restricting Iran’s nuclear program, which Iran says is only for civilian purposes, in return for permanent sanctions relief. But even if war can be avoided, the space for talking is narrow, European officials and analysts say, because by the end of July, the Europeans must signal whether they will reimpose punishing United Nations sanctions against Iran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on Oct. 18. Iran is already under significant sanctions, especially those imposed by Mr. Trump in his first term, and other U.N. sanctions stemming from its ballistic missile program to its human rights record. But the reimposition of these further sweeping sanctions would do significant additional damage to Iran’s already shaky economy. So they are considered important leverage to push Iran toward compliance with the old deal or to negotiate a new one. The Europeans — Britain, France and Germany — remain signatories of the deal and can chose to reimpose the U.N. sanctions, with a notification period included. But their ability to do so, and the leverage it provides, expire in October. If these additional sanctions are reimposed, Iran says it will pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty altogether. And that might cause Israel, with American help, to engage in an extensive military campaign to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. Both Israel and the United States have vowed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The Europeans want to decide before Russia, increasingly an ally of Iran,takes over the presidencyof the Security Council for the month of October. On Tuesday, Iran is having already scheduled technical talks about its nuclear program with Russian and Chinese officials in Moscow. Separately, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said Russia had welcomed the Oman talks, adding that “we support settling the issue of the Iranian nuclear dossier by political and diplomatic means.”“I am very worried,” said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert and director of the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution. “This tactic of negotiation under threat being used by the Trump administration is not a substitute for a serious policy on Iran.”Already, the United States has moved more long-range stealthy B-2 bombers into range and dispatched a second aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, into the region, while initiating a major bombing campaign against the Houthis, Iran’s allies, which is seen as a message from Washington. Iran is eager to avoid a further set of multilateral sanctions, on top of the ones that Washington imposed after Mr. Trumpwithdrew from the dealin 2018. But the Europeans have said they will reimpose sanctions absent a new nuclear deal. That has prompted Iran to vow that it would then abandon the nonproliferation treaty, which has a 90-day timeline, which might even then allow for some last-minute diplomacy. Even if Iran agreed to keep international nuclear inspectors in the country, the International Atomic Energy Agency, in charge of implementation of the treaty, has made it clear that Iran’s previous refusals to be open with its inspectors mean that the world is already blinded to a significant degree about Iran’s nuclear program. And an unregulated Iranian nuclear program — with the strong potential for a breakout to produce even a primitive nuclear weapon — may prompt Israel and the United States to attack Iran. The West and Israel are concerned thatTehran has been secretly planning a faster, cruder approachto building a weapon; it already has enough near weapons-grade uranium to build at least six bombs, according to I.A.E.A. data. “It’s hard to imagine that Israel would be happy with a nuclear program as advanced as Iran’s without U.N. supervision,” said Ali Vaez, Iran project director for the International Crisis Group. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House on Monday. Iran came up during the Israeli leader’s visit. A bombing campaign would most likely prompt serious Iranian counterattacks on American and Israeli targets and Gulf infrastructure, like Saudi oil facilities, which no Arab nation in the region wants to see. It could also prompt Iran to weaponize its nuclear program and build a bomb. Whether the Europeans will be willing or legally able to postpone the deadline for imposing more sanctions is unclear, analysts say. But there would have to be enormous progress toward a new deal to even consider the option. Given mutual mistrust — after all, Mr. Trump alreadypulled out of one nuclear deal— a new accord would have to “perpetually restrain Iran’s nuclear advancement in return for perpetual economic guarantees,” ones that Ayatollah Khamenei, “who is deeply anti-American,” believes will be guaranteed, said Ms. Vakil, the Mideast specialist at Chatham House. Iran is also likely to want strong security guarantees for the future of the regime. Mr. Netanyahu said on Monday in the Oval Office that he sought a deal “the way it was done in Libya,” referring to 2003, when Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, then the leader, agreed to eliminate all of his country’s weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear-weapons program. If Mr. Trump “seeks to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program Libya-style, in addition to closing down Iran’s missile program and Tehran’s relations with its regional partners, then diplomacy will most likely be dead on arrival,”argued Trita Parsi, an Iran expert at the Quincy Institute. But if Mr. Trump’s strategy “is centered on achieving a verification-based deal that prevents an Iranian bomb — his only red line — then there is reason to be optimistic about upcoming talks,” he continued. Mr. Vaez believes the Iranians are skeptical about getting a deal with Mr. Trump. “I see signs that they are preparing for war,” he said, including efforts to increase social cohesion, vowing not to enforce a strict law on the hijab, releasing some political prisoners and warning about protests. After Israel’s efforts to destroy Iran’s proxies and allies in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Israel air attacks on Iran’s missile defenses, Iran is perceived as militarily vulnerable. But Mr. Vaez warns of overconfidence. “No doubt the Iranians are weakened, but they are not weak, and they are not desperate,” he said. “Iran does not want to validate pressure as a tool for concessions, which is a slippery slope,” he said. “For Khamenei, the one thing more dangerous than suffering from U.S. sanctions is surrendering to them.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Frantic Search for Survivors as Roof Collapse in Dominican Republic Kills at Least 89,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/americas/dominican-republic-nightclub-collapse.html,2025-04-08T11:29:16Z,World,"Heavy machinery and drones were part of a large search and rescue operation at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, the capital.",Bars and Nightclubs; Deaths (Fatalities),,Dominican Republic; Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic),,"Rescue workers searching for survivors at the Jet Set nightclub after its roof collapsed during a merengue concert Tuesday in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Hogla Enecia Pérez reported from the scene of the disaster in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic. Frantic Search for Survivors as Roof Collapse in Dominican Republic Kills at Least 89Heavy machinery and drones were part of a large search and rescue operation at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, the capital. The death toll in Tuesday’s nightclub roof collapse in the Dominican Republic kept steadily rising, as rescue workers using heavy machinery, drones and dogs worked into the night in a frantic quest to find survivors. By late Tuesday, at least 89 people had died, after the roof suddenly caved in at about 12:45 a.m. during a concert at Jet Set, a popular nightclub in Santo Domingo. Its Monday night dance party was a decades-old tradition frequented by a who’s who of Dominican society — many of whom were still trapped inside. Among those either killed or injured during the merengue concert were a governor, a member of the Dominican Republic’s congress and two former U.S. Major League Baseball players. “There are not enough words to express the pain this event causes,” the club’s owner, Antonio Espaillat, said ina videoposted on social media. “What happened has been devastating for everyone.”Officials said they were focused on rescues and had not yet begun to investigate the cause of the tragedy. The building, a former movie theater, was at least 50 years old and had been the scene of a fire several years ago. The authorities said it was unclear how many people were inside at the time of the collapse. Victims were still being pulled from the rubble, alive and dead. With each grim update, the death toll climbed. By late Tuesday evening, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences had received 89 bodies, according to its director, Santos Jiménez. In a series ofsocial mediaposts, officials said rescuers made at least 155 trips to local hospitals. So many people were injured that ambulances initially had to carry two or three to the hospital at a time, Juan Manuel Méndez, the director of the Emergency Operations Center, said in an Instagram video shared by the national police. “We are taking out the people we can rescue alive,” Mr. Méndez said. “You can hear people asking to be helped.”Rescue workers carrying a person pulled from the wreckage of the nightclub on Tuesday. Jet Set, which has been open for 50 years, is one of the mostfamousclubsin the Dominican Republic. It is especially well known for itsMonday shows, a staple of live music in the city. Anxious family members gathered at the scene under a blazing sun, desperate for news of their loved ones. Some people said they had up to seven relatives missing following the disaster. Among those at the nightclub was Nelsy M. Cruz Martínez, the governor of the Dominican province Monte Cristi, an area in the northwest of the country near the border with Haiti. Ms. Cruz called President Luis Abinader at 12:49 a.m., while she was trapped in the rubble, the first lady, Raquel P. Arbaje,told reporters at the scene. Ms. Cruz died later in a hospital,Mr. Abinader saidoutside the club Tuesday morning. “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub,” Mr. Abinadersaid on X. “We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred.”Jet Set is a popular nightclub whose Monday night dance party was a decades-old tradition frequented by a who’s who of Dominican society. Octavio Dotel, 51, a former pitcher in the Major Leagues, was pulled from the rubble and taken to an area hospital. He later died, the Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republicannounced. Another former major league baseball player, Tony Blanco, also died, the commissioner of Major League Baseball confirmed in a statement. Several members of the Dominican Congress were thought to have been inside the club, and several lawmakers went to the site. Carlos J. Gil Rodríguez, who represents Santo Domingo in congress, was injured and required emergency surgery, his office said. His wife was injured and released from the hospital, but his two assistants who were also at the event have not been found. “My dear brother!” one woman screamed upon learning that her sibling had not survived. Another woman, Yeheris Ventura, sobbed as she described the anxiety of not hearing from her husband, Gálver Silvestre, who was at the club and whose name was not among the list of survivors or the dead that had been circulated. Monday’s show featured Rubby Pérez, a merengue singer. Videoscirculatingon social media and verified by The New York Times showed Mr. Pérez performing before a group of revelers. The camera began shaking and people started screaming as a large chandelier dropped from the ceiling. Anothervideo, filmed in the aftermath and also verified by The Times, captured the extensive destruction, showing that almost the entire roof had collapsed, with rubble covering the stage and dance floor as rescuers searched the wreckage. Although the authorities had announced that the singer was at hospital, one of his siblings said those reports were incorrect and that the entertainer remained in the rubble, 14 hours after the collapse. Mr. Pérez has not been located, Mr. Méndez confirmed late Tuesday afternoon. The son of the country’s public works minister and his wife were also still missing, the authorities said. “But we hope in God and pray for favorable outcomes,” the minister, Eduardo Estrella, said in a statement. The commissioner of Major League Baseball, Robert D. Manfred, Jr., released a statement offering condolences for the death of Ms. Cruz and the two former players, noting that Ms. Cruz was the sister of Nelson Cruz, a longtime player and the league’s current special adviser to baseball operations. “The connection between baseball and the Dominican Republic runs deep, and we are thinking of all the Dominican players and fans across the game today,” he said. Carlos Mendoza Díaz, president of the Dominican Association of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors, said the Jet Set building was decades old and had recently been damaged. “We have gathered information that it was not only a structure over 50 years old, built for a movie theater and later converted into a nightclub, and obviously these are different safety parameters,” he said. “We also know that a fire occurred a few years ago, and perhaps the combination of these events could have caused the collapse.”Nader Ibrahim, Amelia Nierenberg and Jonathan Wolfe contributed reporting."
"With Trump’s Return, Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints on Gaza Than Ever",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza.html,2025-04-08T10:33:24Z,World,"On the war, President Trump is more aligned than his predecessor with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.",Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); United States International Relations; International Relations,"Biden, Joseph R Jr; Netanyahu, Benjamin; Trump, Donald J",Gaza Strip; Israel; Middle East; United States,,"President Trump with Mr. Netanyahu after their meeting at the White House on Monday. Political analysts say Mr. Trump’s return to power has unleashed Mr. Netanyahu, removing guardrails that might have constrained his actions in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Michael Shear and Aaron Boxerman reported from LondonWith Trump’s Return, Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints on Gaza Than Evernews analysisOn the war, President Trump is more aligned than his predecessor with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition. There was a time, not long ago, when Israel’s resumption of the war in the Gaza Strip three weeks ago — a renewed offensive that has already claimed more than a thousand casualties — would have unleashed fierce Western pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s prime minister. The condemnations would have been swift, in public and in backroom conversations. The demands for restraint would have come from Europe and the White House, where during four years, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sometimes tried, and often failed, to contain Mr. Netanyahu’s impulses. Now Mr. Biden is gone, and President Trump has made it clear that he has no intention of continuing the finger-wagging of his predecessor. Europe is distracted by Mr. Trump’s trade war, and Mr. Netanyahu has consolidated his coalition’s majority in Israel’s Parliament, giving him more political space to act. On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu sat next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president lauded him as “a great leader.” The prime minister did not get relief from the 17 percent tariffs Mr. Trump said will be levied on Israel — one of the key objectives of his trip — nor did he get immediate U.S. backing for military action on Iran’s nuclear facilities. And at times he appeared nonplused as Mr. Trump spoke at length about trade, immigration and the U.S. economy. But on the overriding question of Israel’s renewed military campaign in Gaza, Mr. Trump was largely quiet. He made no mention of the Israeli attack onambulances and a fire truckthat came to light last week, and thatkilled15 emergency workers, or the April 3 strike thatkilled dozensof people, including children, in a school-turned-shelter. “I definitely think Netanyahu is trying to take advantage of what he thinks is increased room to maneuver,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. She said the prime minister appeared emboldened by Mr. Trump’s silence in the face of the escalating Israeliattacksinside Gaza after a cease-fire that lasted just two months. The result, say observers inside and outside of Israel, is a prime minister unleashed, with fewer guardrails to constrain his actions in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. It means that Mr. Netanyahu is free to resume his overhaul of his country’s judicial system without denunciations from Washington. And it means a changed dynamic in a region that has been battered by 18 months of armed conflict. Palestinians fleeing the Shajaiye neighborhood in Gaza City on Thursday with their belongings, after Israel issued evacuation orders and moved ground troops in to expand a buffer zone. Israel has nowbarred aidfrom entering Gaza for over a month. Israeli forces patrol parts of southern Lebanon and Syria, where Israeli leaders say they will remain indefinitely. One enemy, the powerful Lebanese militia Hezbollah, was badly weakened in war with Israel; another, the Assad regime in Syria, was toppled by rebels. Critics of Mr. Netanyahu note that he has resisted global opinion for years, hawking himself to the Israeli public as a leader who would defy the world to protect the country. He shrugged off American and global criticism over the intensity of Israel’s response after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas, in a military campaign that has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry. “What little pressure there was could be dismissed and was dismissed,” said Daniel Levy, the president of the U.S.\u002FMiddle East Project, a group based in London and New York. Still, the difference between then and now is striking, they say. On Gaza, Mr. Biden repeatedly expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself, prompting some in the United States to accuse him of not putting enough pressure on Israel to stop the deaths of civilians. But Mr. Biden did criticize the massive airstrikes during Israel’s military campaign, at one point calling it “over the top” and saying thatthe suffering of innocentshas “got to stop.”Last June, heaccused Mr. Netanyahuof seeking to prolong the war for domestic political reasons. And while he never cut off the flow of weapons to Israel, Mr. Biden diddelay the deliveryof America’s largest bombs. Before the war, Mr. Biden also pressured the Israeli prime minister to temper his efforts to overhaul his country’s judicial system, a plan that critics called a blatant power grab and an existential threat to Israel’s liberal democracy. “They cannot continue down this road — I’ve sort of made that clear,” Mr. Biden said, in a remarkably direct rebuke to one of America’s closest allies. Now, that pressure has evaporated. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared emboldened by Donald Trump’s silence in the face of the escalating Israeli attacks inside Gaza after a cease-fire that lasted just 59 days. Mr. Trump has not challenged Mr. Netanyahu on the judicial plan. And the president's own actions — attacking judges and law firms that have displeased him — may be seen by Mr. Netanyahu as a kind of permission slip for his own efforts, analysts say. One former senior U.S. official said Mr. Netanyahu sees Mr. Trump as a “fellow traveler” when it comes to his efforts to reshape the judiciary to his liking. Nadav Shtrauchler, a former adviser to Mr. Netanyahu, said that the prime minister had experienced “a complete reversal” under the Trump administration that allowed him “much more room to operate.”Mr. Netanyahu has even begun to echo Mr. Trump’s own rhetorical flourishes, repeatedly attacking his opponents as members of a “deep state” dedicated to persecuting him. “I haven’t heard any concerns from the Trump administration about ‘Israeli democracy’ or pressure on Netanyahu,” said Mr. Shtrauchler. “Just the opposite.”At home, Mr. Netanyahu has stabilized his political position by removing almost every threat to his hard-right governing coalition, said Mr. Shtrauchler. And while his critics might consider the moves autocratic, he added, Mr. Netanyahu’s constituency remains resolutely behind him, giving him a free hand. Defying his detractors, since the Oct. 7 attacks, the worst security failure in Israeli history, the prime minister has clawed himself back to a position of strength. Last month, he moved to fire his intelligence chief and his attorney general, actions seen as part of an effort to consolidate power and eliminate rivals. Israelis marched in a protest against Mr. Netanyahu and his plans to dismiss the head of Shin Bet in Jerusalem last month. In Europe, leaders who once spoke out forcefully about Mr. Netanyahu’s actions are distracted by Mr. Trump’s tariffs and the scramble to head off a global financial crisis. And the continent is still shaken by Mr. Trump’s pivot away from decades-long trans-Atlantic alliances and his outreach toward Russia. Mr. Netanyahu appears increasingly unconcerned with what Europe thinks. In recent days, his governmentblockedtwo British members of Parliament from entering Israel on a fact-finding mission, prompting David Lammy, the foreign secretary, to issue an angry statement calling it “unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning.”In February, Mr. Netanyahu joined with Russia and Mr. Trump to oppose a European effort at the United Nations to express support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity. And last week, Mr. Netanyahu received red-carpet treatment in Hungary from Viktor Orban, the country’s authoritarian leader, who is close with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Netanyahu thanked Mr. Orban for withdrawing his country from the International Criminal Court, which in November issued arrest warrants for Mr. Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. But Mr. Netanyahu’s latest actions in Gaza have been the most striking. Opposition to his decision to restart the fighting has been fairly muted in Israel, though public polls suggest that most people want a deal to end the fighting and free the hostages held in Gaza, and that majorities of voters do not support the prime minister and his coalition. And Mr. Trump’s comments about Gaza’s future have changed the way Mr. Netanyahu talks about the region’s fate. A tent camp for displaced Palestinians in Gaza City on Friday. The president declared in February that he would supporta mass deportation of Palestinians, to create a “Riviera” on the Gaza Strip, a proposal that would be asevere violationof international law. Since then, Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians have more openly talked about a future in which Israel controls the area indefinitely. On Tuesday, after Mr. Trump repeated the idea, Mr. Netanyahu praised it as a benefit to the people of Gaza. “They’re locked in. And what is wrong with giving people a choice?” Mr. Netanyahu said, while also insisting falsely that Israel had not kept people inside Gaza from leaving for years. The prime minister said that he and the president had talked over lunch about countries which he claimed were willing to take in Palestinians who wanted to leave Gaza. Egypt and Jordan have repeatedly refused to do so. “The president has a vision,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Countries are responding to that vision. We’re working on it.”In Israel, the idea that Palestinians would be deported from Gaza was once the province of a far-right fringe. It is now endorsed by the U.S. president and repeated by Mr. Netanyahu, and Israel’s defense minister has established an office to oversee the policy. “The encouragement, the boost it has given is to a camp in Israel which is very extreme, very zero-sum and was gaining power but is now really feeling it can operationalize things,“ Mr. Levy said.

Reporting from JerusalemIsrael’s Supreme Court Pauses Netanyahu’s Attempt to Fire Spy ChiefAn Israeli Supreme Court panel began hearing a case on Tuesday over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to fire the chief of the Shin Bet. The hearing opened with unruly scenes as hecklers forced the justices to halt the proceedings and then to resume them without a public audience. The government was handed a deadline to find a compromise. Israel’s highest court on Tuesday gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government a deadline to find a compromise over hisfiring of one of his top intelligence chiefs, part of a courtroom battle that could lead to a constitutional crisis. The attempt to fire Ronen Bar, the Shin Bet chief, has further polarized an already divided Israel. Supporters of the government view Mr. Bar as disloyal to Mr. Netanyahu, but critics consider his removal a dangerous precedent that undermines the independence of democratic institutions. The hearing, which was broadcast live in Israel, opened with unruly scenes as hecklers, including a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, forced the judges to pause the proceedings and then resume them without a public audience. The lawmaker, Tally Gotliv, had to be forcibly removed from the courtroom. The hearing lasted almost 11 hours and ended with the issuing of an interim order against Mr. Bar’s dismissal. The judges gavethe attorney generaland the government until April 20 to come up with a “creative solution.”The court stipulated that Mr. Bar was to remain in his job for now. What’s the case? Last month, Mr. Netanyahufired Mr. Bar, saying that he no longer trusted him. Critics say Mr. Netanyahu fired Mr. Bar to try to seize greater power by purging a dissenting voice from Israel’s security establishment. As head of the Shin Bet, Mr. Bar helped to spearhead Israel’s war in Gaza and to oversee theoccupation of the West Bank. He was also one of a handful of senior officials who led cease-fire negotiations with Hamas to release dozens of hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that ignited the war. The decision to fire Mr. Bar came after the Shin Bet began investigating Mr. Netanyahu’s aides for potential security breaches over theirties with the Gulf state of Qatar. Mr. Netanyahu accused Israeli investigators who detained his advisers of holding them as “hostages.”Israeli legal experts said that if the sides failed to reach a compromise, the Supreme Court could strike down Mr. Bar’s removal. That would leave Mr. Netanyahu’s government with the choice of either swallowing a bitter defeat or rejecting the top court’s ruling. What’s the bigger picture? Mr. Netanyahu’s critics view the firing of the independent-minded Mr. Bar as part of a broader process ofedging Israel toward autocracy. They say by removing Mr. Bar, Mr. Netanyahu is seeking greater control over the powerful domestic intelligence agency. Israel maintains a decades-long military occupation in the West Bank, where millions of Palestinianshave few civil rightsunder a two-tier legal system. But inside Israel’s internationally recognized borders, the country remains a democracy with a robust judiciary and a freewheeling press. Since his return to power in 2022, Mr. Netanyahu has advanced a number of changes intended to weaken checks on executive power. His government proposeda controversial judicial overhaulthat would have removed much of the Supreme Court’s ability to restrain government power. Mr. Netanyahu argued that his proposals were the will of the majority who had elected the current coalition. But they prompted mass protests by opponents who worried it would make the country less free. What happened in court? The chief justice, Isaac Amit, described the decision to fire Mr. Bar as “unprecedented.”Zion Amir, a lawyer representing the government, said in his opening argument that the court was being dragged into intervening in a decision reached unanimously by a democratically elected government and that the court lacked the authority to overturn the firing. Eliad Shraga, a lawyer representing one of several watchdog groups that petitioned the court against Mr. Bar’s dismissal, said that Israel was one second away from collapsing as a liberal democracy and that only the judges could stop the countdown. How could the court rule? The government had originally set April 10 as Mr. Bar’s last day on the job. The Supreme Court had already frozen his dismissal but said that Mr. Netanyahu could interview potential replacements as it prepared to hear the case. Mr. Netanyahu argues that the law empowers him to fire the head of the Shin Bet. But legal experts say there are a number of issues that might lead the justices to order that Mr. Bar stay in his job, at least until a further review. In the courtroom on Tuesday. The attempt to fire Mr. Bar has further polarized an already divided Israel. The Shin Bet has been investigating Mr. Netanyahu’s office, meaning the justices could nullify Mr. Netanyahu’s decision if they find it was motivated by a conflict of interest. They might also decide that his proposed rationale — mistrust — does not constitute grounds for firing a civil servant. How could this lead to a constitutional crisis? Mr. Netanyahu has frequently clashed with the Supreme Court and said that it has no right to intervene in major decisions. He has yet to say whether he would respect the ruling if the justices decide to strike down Mr. Bar’s dismissal. Rejecting a Supreme Court decision would be a tectonic move, potentially paralyzing a major security agency at a time of war and throwing the balance of power in Israel further into doubt.

She was forced out of office by her own Conservative Party in little more than six weeks, the shortest tenure for a prime minister in British history. Reporting from LondonIs This America’s Liz Truss Moment? Ms. Truss, Britain’s prime minister for 44 days, was forced out after her radical policies caused a market meltdown. But there are some key differences with President Trump. A major Western leader announces an unorthodox economic policy, panicking the financial markets, driving down the country’s currency and fueling a blizzard of warnings about the dire long-term consequences. President Trump did all this with his across-the-board tariffs, announced last week, but before him, there wasLiz Truss, Britain’s former prime minister, with her rollout of sweeping tax cuts over 44 turbulent days in the fall of 2022. The parallels between Mr. Trump and Ms. Truss are striking, but for one crucial difference: She was forced to rescind the tax cuts within days, andforced out of officeby her own Conservative Party in little more than six weeks, the shortest tenure for a prime minister in British history. To some analysts, that difference is a tribute to the flexibility of Britain’s parliamentary government and a salutary distinction between Britain and the United States. So far, Mr. Trump has vowed to stick with his tariffs, no matter the carnage theywreak in the marketsor whether they trigger a recession, and there seems to be little anybody can do to force him to change course. “Truss could really only damage the United Kingdom,” said Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at Kings College London. “Ultimately, U.K. institutions, in particular Parliament and the media, were enough to ensure that the system worked.”“Whether that is the case in the U.S. remains to be seen,” he added. “If it isn’t, the whole world will pay the price.”Britain, which Mr. Trump hit with a tariff of 10 percent, is already acting like a country on the brink of crisis. In a bid to shore up the British auto industry, the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, announced he wouldrelax rules for luxury carmakerslike Aston-Martin and McLaren requiring them to phase out gasoline and diesel-powered cars by 2030. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Jaguar Land Rover factory in Birmingham on Monday. He announced that he would relax rules requiring luxury carmakers to phase out combustion engine cars by 2030. Yet when Mr. Starmer was asked on Monday whether he would stick to his government’s fiscal rules that put limits on public borrowing, even in the wake of Mr. Trump’s tariffs, he invoked Ms. Truss’s misbegotten tax cuts as a cautionary example. “Liz Truss tried an experiment with this country of putting aside fiscal rules and checks and balances,” Mr. Starmer said. “And that caused a massive impact on the lives of working people as inflation and interest rates went through the roof.”Like Mr. Trump and his fascination with tariffs, Ms. Truss was ideologically committed to trickle-down tax policy. And like him, she was an outlier. Her tax cuts, which she had planned to fund by increasing borrowing, were viewed skeptically by economists. She was proposing an inflationary policy at a moment when Britain and other countries were battling rising energy prices and acost-of-living crisis. And she declined to submit her plans to scrutiny by the government’s fiscal watchdog, the Office of Budget Responsibility. The markets responded by torpedoing shares of British companies and pushing the pound down to near parity with the American dollar. The International Monetary Fund warned of Britain’s financial instability. As a smaller economy, Britain was more vulnerable to these gyrations than the United States. Yields on government bonds spiked under Ms. Truss, stoking fears of a credit crisis and ultimately leading to her downfall. Yields on Treasury bills declined even as Mr. Trump’s tariffs were rolling out, reflecting the United States’ traditional status as a haven for investors and protecting the president from some of the pressure faced by Ms. Truss. Though on Monday, they, too, began to rise. Within days, Ms. Truss withdrew the tax cuts and dismissed her chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, a key architect of the supply-side policy. The Bank of England intervened toprop up British bondsand the market turmoil subsided. But Ms. Truss’s credibility was shattered. After senior members of her party told her she had lost their faith, she handed in her resignation. Liz Truss with Kwasi Kwarteng, her chancellor of the Exchequer, in October 2022, the same month she fired him and later resigned herself. “Like Truss, the market reaction is not just driven by the actual policy changes, damaging as they were in both cases, but by their attempt to destroy the institutions that normally constrain policy,” Professor Portes said. For all of Ms. Truss’s missteps, some economists argue that her tax cuts could be considered less radical than Mr. Trump’s tariffs. In a different fiscal environment, her supply-side agenda would have been relatively conventional for a right-of-center government. But in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, whichstoked inflationand led the central bank to raise borrowing costs rapidly, the tax cuts were badly timed and poorly communicated. “The biggest similarity is a crisis of competence,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. “Liz Truss’s policies may have made sense in some other world. But they just came out of the blue, so they didn’t have any credibility.”Professor Rogoff said Mr. Trump’s tariffs had even less credibility among economists, not least because they seem disconnected from any strategy. “Trump has not articulated where we’re going,” he said, “and it’s hard to find anyone who’s not a paid publicist for him who thinks this is a good idea.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

Efrain Hallax is one of 316 pilots authorized by the Authority of the Panama Canal to steer a ship through the canal. Silvana Paternostro and Nathalia Angarita reported from Panama City and the waters of the Panama Canal. Panama Canal Ship Pilot Navigates Tricky Waters, and TrumpThe Global ProfileCapt. Efrain Hallax was part of the first batch of Panamanians hired in 1983 to start replacing the American pilots who had steered ships through the Panama Canal since it opened in 1914. For over 40 years, Capt. Efraín Hallax, 73, has been steering vessels through the canal, and he has seen it all, from a dictator’s fall to the rise of U.S. interest in retaking the waterway. Hanging from a ladder attached to the hull of a giant, bobbing tanker, Capt. Efraín Hallax began his climb up to the crew awaiting him atop the Athina, a ship anchored in Panama Bay and third in line to transit the Panama Canal. The daunting ascent up the shifting ship was nothing new for Captain Hallax, 73. He has been a ship’s pilot in the Panama Canal for over 40 years, responsible for guiding vessels through the trade-critical corridor that connects the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean Sea. On this night in February, Captain Hallax reported for work a half-hour before midnight — and just a few hours after President Trump had canceled a call with President José Raúl Mulino of Panama to continue their negotiations over the future of the canal, which the U.S. president wants returned to American control. The overnight crossing was nothing out of the ordinary for the captain. With about 3 percent of the world’s maritime trade carried through its locks, the Panama Canal is a 24-hour operation. “Business as usual,” said Captain Hallax. “Always business as usual in the Panama Canal, no matter Christmas, no matter rain, no matter fog, no matter nothing, no matter Trump.”Captain Hallax is one of 310 pilots — six are women — authorized by the Authority of the Panama Canal to steer a ship through the trade-critical waterway. As he took his first sip of the night’s many coffees, Captain Hallax said alertness was a pilot’s essential ally, and he counts on the caffeine — plus ice over his eyes — to help keep him awake. “You see nothing at this time, just little lights,” he said. “Blinking can cost you your life.”Captain Hallax is one of 310 pilots — six are women — authorized by the Authority of the Panama Canal to steer a ship through the waterway. These pilots are the only ones allowed to make the 50-mile transit, with the ship’s captain required to cede control for the complex journey through the isthmus passage. Informed by the marine traffic control tower about the night’s traffic, he knew what to expect: which ship to follow and what restrictions were in place. “It’s a bit like chess, a constant calculation,” he said. The Athina is small enough to fit through the three sets of locks, named Miraflores, Pedro Miguel and Gatun, which were built by the American government and have been operating since the canal opened in 1914. (In 2006, wider locks for bigger ships were opened.) In good weather, the transit takes about 10 hours. About 40 ships can make the journey daily, and the more ships that cross, the more money Panama makes. And it’s a lot. The Panama Canal uses a system of locks that raise and lower ships to overcome the elevation difference between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Always profitable, the canal “is a cash cow for the country,” Captain Hallax said. In 2024, it contributed $2.4 billion to government coffers. The canal is narrow and crowded, and job No. 1 for the pilots is using their expert local knowledge to make sure the ships they are helming don’t hit the sides, or another vessel. “They are highly specialized drivers,” said John Feeley, a former United States ambassador to Panama, “trained to move the biggest moving structures on Planet Earth, like watching a horizontal skyscraper move.”As was made clear by the global trade bottleneck created when acontainer ship got stuckin the Suez Canal,a mistake made in a canal’s constricted waterway can have consequences felt around the world. Captain Hallax was told the Miraflores locks were available at 2:30 a.m., so as soon as he arrived on deck, he took command of the ship. The bridge of a ship traversing the Panama Canal at night. “Sometimes there is friction with some of the captains,” he said of the power transfer. “It’s like asking someone for his wife.”Steering from inside the bridge on a foggy night or during a downpour can get especially difficult, and dangerous. “I sometimes cannot see my nose,” Captain Hallax said. But tonight’s crossing would at least start out easy. “Sea is calm now,” Captain Hallax said as he surveyed the water around him, “but this time of the year the winds can be tricky out there.”While tankers like the Athina are common assignments, the range of ships he pilots is wide. “Anything that floats,” he said, including military vessels. “U.S. submarines pop up often, he said. Raised in a semirural neighborhood on the outskirts of Panama City, Captain Hallax said that from a young age he had always wanted to see what the outside world looked like. Both his father and stepfather were seamen, “so that was an influence,” he said. But it was the advice he received at a young age from an American canal pilot who was a family friend that really stuck. “If you want a future in this country,” the American pilot told him, “find yourself a job in the Panama Canal.”Some of the souvenirs Captain Hallax has picked up during his peripatetic career at sea. Nautical-themed decorations in Captain Hallax’s home. At the time, that dream was out of reach. The U.S. Canal Zone was a mostly forbidden fantasy land — except for a once-a-month visit with an aunt to visit her friend in the Zone. To the boy living at times without water and electricity, “everything was perfect in the Zone,” he recalled. “The streets, the trees, the mangoes. The lightbulbs worked. The buses ran.”When he reached adulthood, the Canal Zone was still shut to Panamanians. “It was impossible to go knock on the door of a maritime agency, he said. “They were all inside the Zone.”Thanks to a scholarship, Captain Hallax attended the Arturo Prat Naval Academy in Chile, and his peripatetic sea career began. But the jobs open to a Panamanian weren’t the best: “From lousy tramp steamer to lousy tramp steamer,” he said. He picked up additional maritime training wherever he could, from New York to Italy. Some ships on which he served crossed the Panama Canal. “I felt like I was in another country, not my own,” he said. In 1977, when the globe-sailing Captain Hallax was in his mid-20s, Panama signed the treaty with the United States that would give it full control of the canal in 20 years. Knowing it needed to fill a huge void of trained pilots, Panama’s government put out an open call for all Panamanian seamen with a first officer license and at least eight years of navigation experience. At the time, Captain Hallax was working on a cruise ship in Oregon. Captain Hallax meeting with other pilots at the Panama Canal Pilots Association in Panama City. He applied immediately, and in 1983, he became one of the nine Panamanians who made up the first batch of pilots hired to start replacing the Americans. Today, the pilots come from varied backgrounds, but share one thing. “They are exquisitely paid,” said Mr. Feeley, the ex-ambassador. Pilots make about $350,000 a year — and double that if they’re willing to forego a normal life and work all the time. But Captain Hallax opted not to spend every hour at sea. A single man until he was 62, his other jobs included owning three bars, two named after pirates. The most difficult moment of his canal-crossing career is one he has rarely talked about since: He once stopped a ship on purpose, in protest. During the final days of the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Noriega, who ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989, Captain Hallax one day on his way to work saw “a bunch of policemen beat up women indiscriminately.”A few hours later, as he piloted a Turkish boat through the Pedro Miguel locks, “tears rolling down my face from rage,” he dropped the ship’s anchor at the narrow entry to Gatun Lake and took to the ship’s radio to announce his protest against Noriega. The stoppage — “the dumbest thing I’ve ever done,” he said — lasted 15 minutes. He was fired, and with Noriega’s goons looking for him, he went into hiding. But just two weeks later, President George H.W. Bush ordered an invasion of Panama. The canal was closed for a week, and Noriega was soon arrested. Captain Hallax predicts that politics will have few effects on the Canal’s commerce. Captain Hallax’s lawyer argued that his action should be considered heroic resistance, not insubordination, and weeks after “that stupidity,” he said, he was rehired. The night’s crossing of the Athina went off without a hitch, and Captain Hallax arrived home the next morning. “Sleepy,” he said. He plans to keep piloting another two years, then retire to see more of the world — this time on foot. “I’ve discovered I like to walk,” he said. Whatever becomes of Mr. Trump’s Canal interest, Captain Hallax doesn’t expect much to change for pilots. The sea, the wind, the fear, the exhaustion and the bad shipboard food will remain. “Politics,” he said, “won’t change these things.”How a British Dad Made Comedy Gold: George Lewis’s riffs on the absurdities of millennial parenting — and the inner lives of 2-year-olds — havewon him legions of fans onlineand galvanized his once middling stand-up career.

Three Court of Appeal judges will hear arguments by Harry’s lawyers that the decision to withdraw his police protection in the UK violated official policy. Reporting from LondonPrince Harry’s Court Case Over Security in the U.K., ExplainedHarry arrived at London’s Court of Appeal on Tuesday for the start of a two-day hearing in his case over his police protection in Britain. On Tuesday, Prince Harry arrived at England’s Court of Appeal for the start of a two-day hearing in his legal case over the withdrawal of publicly financed security for his family during their visits to the U.K. After Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, announced they werestepping downfrom their royal roles and leaving Britain in 2020, an official committee decided that the couple would no longer be eligible for the police protection normally given to royal family members. Harry is challenging that decision. Helost a previous stageof the case in February last year, but a judge later granted himpermission to appealthe ruling on limited grounds. The judge said that he was persuaded, although “not without hesitation,” that an appeal had a “real prospect of success.”Three judges at London’s Court of Appeal will hear arguments by Harry’s lawyers that the decision to withdraw protection violated official policy. Part of the case will be conducted in private because of the sensitive nature of evidence around security processes and risk assessments, the court ruled. Harry leaving a London court in 2023 during a previous hearing to challenge the removal of his security detail. What is the case about? The case concerns a Feb. 28, 2020, decision that Harry and Meghan would no longer qualify for publicly financed security protection in the U.K., after they withdrew from their official roles and started a new life in Canada. In March 2020, they moved from Vancouver to California. The decision was made by a body called the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known as Ravec, which brings together government officials, the police and members of the royal household. Ravec is responsible for making security arrangements for the royal family and other U.K.-based figures who are at particular risk from terrorism, obsessive behavior or other threats. During the first stage of Harry’s case, heard at the High Court in London in 2022, his lawyers said that he had not known that the committee existed and had no opportunity to weigh in on its decision. After being told that discussions were taking place over his security provision, he wrote a letter to a government official expressing disbelief and concern. The letter, dated Feb. 10, 2020, mentioned his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. Harry argued that his family was at even greater risk because of “additional layers of racism and extremism,” and that security from the Metropolitan Police in London was essential. He wrote that he believed the lack of consultation could be “some form of punishment for protecting my family and putting them first” — an accusation the British government has denied. In 2022, Harry and Meghan visited Britain to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, and paid for security. Harry offered to reimburse or pay for the cost of security measures but the committee decided that would be wrong “in principle.”What has happened in the case so far? Harry launched his legal challenge in September 2021, arguing that Ravec had violated its own policy by withdrawing publicly funded protection, that the committee had failed to consider key factors, and that it had not followed a fair process and was insufficiently transparent. In the first stage of the case, in July 2022, the court heard testimony that Harry offered to“reimburse or proactively finance the cost of the security measures” himself, but Ravec decided that would be wrong “in principle.” The Home Office told the court that the committee decided it was not appropriate for wealthy people to “buy” protective security such as armed police from the government, when it had already decided that the protection was not warranted on a publicly funded basis. Ravec was said to be concerned that permitting private funding would “reduce the availability” of a limited pool of close protection officers in Britain, where police are not routinely armed and undergo intensive specialist training for the role. Harry lost a specific legal challenge on the funding decision in 2023, and a High Court judgedismissed his caseon wider grounds in February 2024. He was granted permission to appeal three months later, but only on legal points concerning whether Ravec had violated its own policy. While the case has been continuing, Harry has visited the U.K. on several occasions, including for the funeral of his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, and for the coronation of his father King Charles III, and has paid for private security. The High Court heard testimony that Harry’s representatives had applied to Ravec for public security protections for each visit. When will we know the verdict? After the two-day hearing concludes on Wednesday, the Court of Appeal judges may announce their ruling on the same day or “reserve judgment,” meaning that they will privately deliberate for weeks or months before announcing their decision. Whichever side loses the case can apply for permission to mount an appeal at the U.K.’s Supreme Court. Permission is not automatically granted, because judges must decide whether there is any prospect that it would be successful. Britain’s Home Office said it could not comment directly on the court case but said in a statement: “The U.K. government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our longstanding policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

How Japan Built a 3D-Printed Train Station in 6 Hours,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/asia/japan-3d-station.html,2025-04-08T04:01:08Z,World,"As Japan’s population shrinks, maintaining rail service in remote small towns is becoming a challenge. Is this the answer?",3-D Printers; Stations and Terminals (Passenger),,Japan,,"The new Hatsushima train station was printed at a factory, shipped to the Japanese city of Arida and assembled overnight. Reporting from Arida, JapanHow Japan Built a 3D-Printed Train Station in 6 HoursAs Japan’s population shrinks, maintaining rail service in remote small towns is becoming a challenge. Is this the answer? In the six hours between the departure of the night’s last train and the arrival of the morning’s first one, workers in rural Japan built an entirely new train station. It will replace a significantly bigger wooden structure that has served commuters in this remote community for over 75 years. The new station’s components were 3D-printed elsewhere and assembled on site last month, in what the railway’s operators say is a world first. It may look more like a shelter than a station, but building one the traditional way would have taken more than two months and cost twice as much, according to the West Japan Railway Company. As Japan’s population ages and its work force shrinks, the maintenance of railway infrastructure, including outdated station buildings, is a growing issue for railway operators. Rural stations with dwindling numbers of users have posed a particular challenge. The new station, Hatsushima, is in a quiet seaside town that’s part of Arida, a 25,000-population city in Wakayama Prefecture, which borders two popular tourist destinations, Osaka and Nara prefectures. The station, served by a single line with trains that run one to three times an hour, serves around 530 riders a day. Yui Nishino, 19, uses it every day for her commute to university. She said she was surprised when she first heard that the world’s first 3D-printed station building was going to be built here. “Watching it, the work is progressing at a speed that would be impossible with normal construction,” she said. “I hope that they can make more buildings with 3D-printing technology.”Serendix, the construction firm that worked with West Japan Railway the project, said printing the parts and reinforcing them with concrete took seven days. The printing was done at a factory in Kumamoto Prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu. The parts left the factory on the morning of March 24 to be transported about 500 miles northeast by road to Hatsushima Station. “Normally, construction takes place over several months while the trains are not running every night,” said Kunihiro Handa, a co-founder of Serendix. Construction work near commercial lines is subject to strict restrictions and is usually carried out overnight so as not to disrupt timetables. As trucks carrying the 3D-printed parts started pulling in on a Tuesday night in late March, several dozen residents gathered to watch the first-of-its-kind initiative get underway, in a place deeply familiar to them. Then, after the last train pulled away at 11:57 p.m., workers got busy building the new station. In less than six hours, the preprinted parts, made of a special mortar, were assembled. They were delivered on separate trucks, and a large crane was used to lift each one down to where workers were piecing them together, just a few feet from the old station. It took less than six hours to put the parts together. Construction started after the night’s last train departed and was finished before the first train arrived in the morning. The new station, which measures just over 100 square feet, was completed before the first train arrived at 5:45 a.m. It is a minimalistic, white building, featuring designs that include a mandarin orange and a scabbardfish, specialties of Arida. It still needed interior work, as well as equipment like ticket machines and transportation card readers. West Japan Railway said it expected to open the new building for use in July. The new station won’t go into service until July, West Japan Railway said. Railway officials say that they hope the station will show how service can be maintained in remote locations with new technology and fewer workers. “We believe that the significance of this project lies in the fact that the total number of people required will be reduced greatly,” said Ryo Kawamoto, president of JR West Innovations, a venture capital unit of the rail operator. The wooden building that the new station will replace was completed in 1948. Since 2018, it has been automated, like many smaller stations in Japan. Toshifumi Norimatsu, 56, who manages the post office a few hundred feet away, had bittersweet feelings about the new building. “I am a little sad about the old station being taken down,” he said. “But I would be happy if this station could become a pioneer and benefit other stations.”The first morning train leaving Hatsushima station after the new building was assembled.

Red Carpet for an Accused War Criminal: Why Is the I.C.C. Under Fire?,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/icc-hungary-us-israel.html,2025-04-08T04:01:08Z,World,"The leaders of Israel, Hungary and the United States have moved to neutralize the judiciary both at home and abroad.",International Relations; United States International Relations; Politics and Government,"Orban, Viktor; Netanyahu, Benjamin; Trump, Donald J",Hungary; Israel,International Criminal Court,"Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article included an incorrect reference to Benjamin Netanyahu. He is Israel’s prime minister, not its president. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary in Budapest last week. Red Carpet for an Accused War Criminal: Why Is the I.C.C. Under Fire? The leaders of Israel, Hungary and the United States have moved to neutralize the judiciary both at home and abroad. There aren’t a lot of countries Israel’s prime minister can visit without risking arrest. Which makes the red-carpet treatment Benjamin Netanyahu received in Hungary — Europe’s only proud “illiberal democracy” — all the more noteworthy. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, invited Mr. Netanyahu right after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant last November for his country’s alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. And within hours of the Israeli prime minister’sarrival in Hungarylast week, Mr. Orban announced his country’s withdrawal from the court. There are several things going on here, analysts say, which tie together the affinities of Mr. Orban, Mr. Netanyahu and President Trump. Bonding: The International Criminal Court is the most ambitious and idealistic — if deeply imperfect — version of an global judicial system to enforce human rights. Most liberals love it. Mr. Orban, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump hate it. Signaling: Mr. Orban is telling the world that Hungary does what it wants: It may be a member of the European Union, but it is not constrained by it. He’s telling China and Russia that Hungary is open for business. And he’s telling his voters at home that it’s Hungary First all the way. Testing boundaries: At a moment when global institutions are crumbling and a new order has not yet emerged, no one knows what’s allowed and what’s forbidden anymore. Leaders vs. the judiciaryHungary is not the first country to make exceptions for Israel. The United States and Germany have long done so. Friedrich Merz, Germany’s incoming chancellor, has also ruled out arresting Mr. Netanyahu, even as Germany remains a committed member of the International Criminal Court. Hungary is also not the first signatory to the Rome Treaty that established the court to ignore it.  When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia visited Mongolia last year, it took no action on an I.C.C. warrant against him. A photograph released by Russian state media showing President Vladimir V. Putin meeting with President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh during a visit to Mongolia in September. But Mr. Orban’s defiance of the court is also about something else: a desire to sideline independent judges, both at home and abroad. “Quite simply, some international institutions have become political bodies,” he told a Hungarian radio program on Friday. “Unfortunately, the International Criminal Court is one of these. It is a political court.”The power struggles between leaders and judges — whether international or domestic — have become a defining political theme in many countries, including Hungary, Israel, Brazil and the United States. Mr. Orban, in power since 2010, is seen by conservatives worldwide as a pioneer in asserting power over the judiciary. He has packed Hungary’sconstitutional courtwith loyalist judges and forced others to resign. He has battled against European Union courts and blasted their “judicial overreach” when they take Hungary to task for violating E.U. rules. Mr. Netanyahu, who has denounced bribery and fraud charges against him in Israel as an effort to derail the will of voters, is pushing for his own controversial judicial overhaul. He and his allies have argued that thejudiciary has granted itself increased authority, and is not representative of the diversity of Israeli society. Mr. Trump, who was convicted on 34 felony counts before being re-elected last year, says that the many legal cases against him were politically motivated. In recent weeks, his administration has defied several court orders, which could eventually lead to a constitutional crisis. And in February, hesigned an executive order placing sanctionson I.C.C. officials in response the arrest warrant for Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu and President Trump at the White House on Monday. All three leaders — Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Orban and Mr. Trump — talked on the phone about the court during the Israeli leader’s visit to Hungary. Mr. Netanyahu visited the White House on Monday, and his office said the I.C.C. was again going to be on the agenda. “It takes a lawless autocrat like Orban to welcome rather than arrest an accused war criminal like Netanyahu,” said Kenneth Roth, a visiting professor at Princeton and the former executive director of Human Rights Watch. Mr. Trump’s imposition of sanctions on I.C.C. staff, he said, “is of a piece with Orban’s move.”Hungary FirstAs Orban is strategically bonding, he is also strategically signaling to allies, investors and voters that Hungary will not be constrained by international rules and norms. It’s a form of identity building, says one prominent thinker about democracy. “Orban is playing special relations — special relations with the Russia, special relations with Trump, special relations with the Chinese,” said Ivan Krastev, chairman of theCenter for Liberal Strategies. “He’s trying to create a story of Hungary being the member of the European Union that can do what they want. ”“So if somebody wants to invest in a country in the EU, go with Hungary,” Mr. Krastev said. “Because they can do what they want. They can veto sanctions. They can leave the International Criminal Court. They’re kind of the only free spirit in the E.U. ”Mr. Orban has called fellow European leaders “warmongers” because of their support for Ukraine. He’s openly lobbying for re-establishing relations with Russia after the war. Welcoming Israel’s prime minister in defiance of the international court was another opportunity for him to showcase Hungary’s contrarian sovereignty. Mr. Krastev sees Mr. Netanyahu’s visit as a precedent — and perhaps preparation — for an even more controversial invitation for someone like Mr. Putin down the line. Mr. Orban laid out his grand strategy for Hungary ina wide-ranging and detailed speechlast July, in which he outlined his vision of a new emerging world order. As he sees it, Western liberalism has lost and nationalism is back. For the next decades, or perhaps centuries, the dominant center of the world will be in Asia, he predicted. Mr. Orban greeting supporters before delivering a speech in Romania last July. For a small economy like Hungary, that means ignoring any marching orders from Brussels or Washington to isolate Moscow or Beijing. “We will not get involved in the war against the East,” he said. “We will not join in the formation of a technological bloc opposing the East, and we will not join in the formation of a trade bloc opposing the East.”China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, during a visit to Hungary last year, promised to invest in the country and open up opportunities for Hungarian firms to invest in China. “We have received an offer from China,” Mr. Orban said. “We will not get a better one.”Trump’s world orderMr. Orban’s defiant welcome of Mr. Netanyahu has highlighted one way the world has changed since Mr. Trump came to power: By throwing out the global rule book on longstanding alliances and trade rules, the American president has given permission to others to break the rules too. They are now testing just how far they can go. “No one knows what’s allowed and what’s forbidden anymore,” Mr. Krastev said. “They’re testing the boundaries.”But Trump’s ideological allies are also experiencing firsthand the unpredictability of the Trump administration, whose policies won’t necessarily be favorable to their countries. Israel and Hungary — a major site of production for Germany’s car industry — are among the major exporting countries that have been hit with significant U.S. tariffs. That’s the intrinsic paradox of “America First” for leaders like Mr. Orban and Mr. Netanyahu: It’s one thing to make common cause with an ally who shares your nationalist agenda. It’s another when “America First” policies put every other country last.

South Korea Sets New Presidential Election for June 3,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/asia/south-korea-election.html,2025-04-08T03:24:17Z,World,"Polls show the main opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, is the front-runner to replace Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office for declaring martial law.",Politics and Government; Elections; Impeachment; Martial Law,Lee Jae-myung; Han Duck-soo; Yoon Suk-yeol,South Korea,,"A candlelight concert took place to celebrate the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol as South Korea’s president on Friday. Reporting from SeoulSouth Korea Sets New Presidential Election for June 3Polls show the main opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, is the front-runner to replace Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office for declaring martial law. South Korea said on Tuesday that it would hold a snap election on June 3 to choose the successor to former President Yoon Suk Yeol, whowas removed​ last weekfor his attempt to impose martial law. The country’s Constitutional Court formally dismissed Mr. Yoon on Friday when its eight justices unanimously endorsed his impeachment by the National Assembly in December. South Korea has since shifted its focus to the question of who should lead the country after months of political turmoil that havetested the resilience of its democracyand weakened its leadership. By law, South Korea must elect a new president within 60 days of the court’s ruling. On Monday, the government confirmed June 3 as Election Day, designating it as a national holiday to encourage voter turnout. In the coming days, the rival political parties will schedule primary races to select their presidential candidates by May 12, when the official campaign will start. Whoever wins the election will assume office immediately — without the country’s typical two-month transition period. Until then, South Korea must continue to deal with external challenges — including President Donald J. Trump’s sweeping 25 percent tariff on its goods — under an unelected interim leader, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Mr. Yoon, is widely expected to win his party’s nomination, although several other politicians have expressed their intention to join its primary race. Mr. Lee was expected to step down as party chairman in the coming days so he could focus on ​his presidential bid. In surveys in recent weeks, more South Koreans expressed wanting Mr. Lee as the next president, by a margin of ​around 25 percentage points. Mr. Lee is on trial on several criminal charges, including bribery, which he says Mr. Yoon’s government filed with political motives. Who Mr. Yoon’s conservative People Power Party will choose is a lot less clear. More than a dozen politicians​, including Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo, have shown interest in competing, but no strong front-runner has emerged yet — in part because the party had until recently focused its efforts on retaining Mr. Yoon as president. Mr. Yoon’s ouster was a crushing blow to the People Power Party: He was the second conservative president in a row to be ousted by impeachment and the third consecutive conservative president to face criminal indictment before or after their term ended. Mr. Yoon is also on trial on charges of committing insurrection when he sent troops to seize the National Assembly during his short-lived imposition of martial law in December. The political crisis triggered by Mr. Yoon’s ill-fated martial law and his subsequent impeachment have left South Korea in limbo at a time when North Korea has accelerated its nuclear ambitions anddeepened military tieswith Russia. The Constitutional Court’s unanimous ruling has removed some political uncertainty. But the ​crisis has exposed a deep-seated acrimony in South Korea’s polarized politics, which will likely continue to surface during the presidential campaign. In the past four months, the People Power Partyhas embraced a narrativechampioned by right-wing YouTube influencers and Mr. Yoon, who have claimed that parliamentary elections in South Korea were rigged with the help of Chinese spies, and that progressive leaders like Mr. Lee were “anti-state forces” who colluded with North Korea and China to undermine South Korea’s alliance with the United States. Mr. Lee’s party accused its conservative rival of using a smear campaign to spread fear and hatred, and divert attention from Mr. Yoon’s disastrous martial law.

"For Xi, China’s Strongman Leader, Ceding to Trump Is Not an Option",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/asia/china-trump-tariffs.html,2025-04-08T03:14:50Z,World,"China sees little to gain in capitulating to President Trump’s tariff threats, labeling them “blackmail” and vowing to “fight to the end.”",United States Politics and Government; United States International Relations; International Trade and World Market; Customs (Tariff); Threats and Threatening Messages,"Trump, Donald J; Xi Jinping",China; United States,Ministry of Commerce (China)," Reporting from Hong KongFor Xi, China’s Strongman Leader, Ceding to Trump Is Not an OptionNews AnalysisChina sees little to gain in capitulating to President Trump’s tariff threats, labeling them “blackmail” and vowing to “fight to the end.”Xi Jinping wants you to know that he will not be cowed. Confronted with thelatest threatfrom President Trump of an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing reverses its retaliatory levies on U.S. imports, China’s top leader has remained defiant. His Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday accused the United States of “blackmail” and declared that Beijing would “fight to the end.”But behind the bravado is a more complicated set of realities for Mr. Xi that makes it politically and economically untenable to offer concessions to the country’s single largest trading partner and chief rival for global influence. With Mr. Trump also refusing to back down, a devastating trade war between the two largest economies may be inevitable — a showdown with painful consequences that will be felt across the world. The dilemma for Mr. Xi is that looking weak is not an option, but hitting back risks further escalation. The Chinese leader has cast himself as a national savior who is rejuvenating his country’s greatness. As a result, Beijing has less flexibility to back down from a fight with Washington, asother U.S. trading partnerslike Vietnamhave tried, because it could undercut Mr. Xi’s legitimacy, analysts say. “Beijing’s response to date has emphasized three things: resolve, resilience, and retaliation,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior China policy official at the White House and State Department under President Biden who is now writing a book on U.S.-China relations. “Xi has built up an image of himself as a defiant strongman helming a powerful country, and China’s official messaging is conveying that they are determined to stand up to U.S. pressure even at high costs,” he said. President Xi Jinping has cast himself as a national savior who is rejuvenating his country’s greatness. That helps explain why Chinascuttled a dealto sell a portion of TikTok to American investors last week in response to Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and why it isresisting a saleof the ports owned by the Hong Kong company CK Hutchison along the Panama Canal. It also plays into why Beijing on Tuesday threatened more countermeasures if Mr. Trump went through with imposing an additional 50 percent in tariffs on Chinese goods. China has said it is willing to hold talks, but not under duress. China’s leaders are also likely calculating that a clash with the Trump administration is inevitable, analysts say. Mr. Trump’s tariffs last week — which also targeted countries like Vietnam and Thailand, where Chinese companies have set up factories to skirt earlier U.S. tariffs — would be seen in Beijing as evidence that Washington is determined to block China’s rise. “From this vantage, there is little to be gained from capitulating to Trump’s latest demand, because it would not resolve the underlying challenge from the United States,” said Ryan Hass, the director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution. “At best, they believe, it would merely postpone America’s determination to destroy China’s economy.”The rising tensions make a meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump increasingly unlikely. Mr. Trump, who regards unpredictability as hissignature weapon, has said he is open to engaging with Mr. Xi, even suggesting the Chinese leader would visit. But Chinese officials arereluctant to schedule a meetinguntil the two sides have negotiated details in advance. Even if Mr. Xi were to cave and submit to Mr. Trump’s demands to cancel China’s retaliatory tariffs, it is unclear what, if any, trade deal would make a meaningful dent in the yawning trade imbalance between the two countries. The United States imported $440 billion worth of Chinese goods last year, more than three times the value of the $144 billion of U.S. goods that China imported. The Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif., on Monday. The United States imported $440 billion worth of Chinese goods last year. Beijing sees Mr. Trump as singularly focused on undermining China’s dominance in exports in order to bring manufacturing back to the United States, said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington. “Decoupling might be the endgame,” Ms. Sun said, describing how China is likely interpreting Mr. Trump’s motives. Mr. Xi has long warned that China’s rise would likely not go unchallenged by the West, and invested heavily in efforts to build up China’s self-reliance. This week, as stock markets around the world tumbled, Beijingmobilized state-owned banksand investment companies, known informally in China as the “national team,” to shore up their holdings of Chinese shares in an effort to stem the decline. Chinese stocks rose slightly on Tuesday after big declines a day earlier. And the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, published a commentary on Sunday urging Chinese citizens to have confidence in China’s ability to weather the tariffs. The piece argued that China has expanded its trade markets outside the United States and that the Chinese economy is growing more self-sufficient with the help of breakthroughs in technology likeartificial intelligence. Economists say those points are true, but that a full-blown trade war on the scale threatened by Mr. Trump will still inflict considerable pain on China. If the Trump administration imposes an additional 50 percent tariff, it could bring the U.S. levy on Chinese goods to 104 percent. For some products, though, the rate is likely to be much higher because of tariffs that date back to Mr. Trump’s first term. People walking in Shanghai next to a screen showing stock declines on Monday. Chinese stocks rose slightly the next day after the government announced measures to support stock markets. Chinese exporters might not be able to simply divert their goods to other countries because the flood of Chinese exports has already been met with concern in major markets like the European Union. At the same time, in this game of tariff brinkmanship, analysts in China think Mr. Trump will be more likely to succumb to domestic pressure to change tack because of the soaring costs of goods and plummeting stock values in the United States. “If it’s a question of who can endure more pain, China will not lose,” said Wang Wen, dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. The United States needed China, Mr. Wang said, more than China needed the United States because Chinese factories make parts and components that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. “Other countries will buy goods from China and then sell them to the United States,” he said. Part of China’s strategy has also been to use the chaotic consequences of Mr. Trump’s tariffs to try to draw the rest of the world away from Washington’s orbit. Mr. Xi is reportedly planning to visit Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam next week. Beijing has also tried to project a united front with Japan and South Korea against Mr. Trump’s tariffs, though officials in Tokyo and Seoul, which both rely on America for security, have distanced themselves from the Chinese position. On the same day that Mr. Trump unveiled his tariffs, China’s Foreign Ministry posted a video on social media casting the United States as a source of harm and instability, with references to the U.S. president’s push to deport migrants and to tariffs imposed on cars newly delivered at a port. “Do you want to live in a world like this?” a narrator asks. New cars waiting for shipment to overseas markets at a port in Taicang, China, on Monday. That was followed by scenes of Chinese peacekeeping troops and Chinese rescue teams pulling victims out of the rubble after Myanmar’s recent earthquake, laid over a soundtrack featuring John Lennon’s “Imagine.”“There’s no question Beijing is milking this moment,” said Danny Russel, a diplomacy and security analyst at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington. The Foreign Ministry’s video is “pure propaganda jujitsu” aimed at “painting Trump’s tariffs as reckless U.S. chaos while China offers order and partnership.”“But the view from Beijing is conflicted,” Mr. Russel said. “Beijing’s instinct is to avoid interrupting its enemy when he’s making a mistake, but they’re also deeply worried those mistakes could crash the global economy, and China with it.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

Vivian Yee reported from Cairo, and Fatima AbdulKarim from Ramallah, West Bank. Video Shows Search for Missing Gaza Paramedics Before Israelis Shoot RescuersThe Palestine Red Crescent released a video made by a paramedic before he was killed, and called the deaths of 15 rescue workers “a full-fledged war crime.” Israel has said it is investigating. The Palestine Red Crescent Society on Monday gave new details of the Israeli attack on its paramedics and other emergency responders in the Gaza Strip that killed at least 15 people last month, saying Israeli forces had targeted them in a “series of deliberate attacks.”Speaking at anews conferencein the West Bank, Red Crescent officials said Israeli troopsshot at the rescue workersin waves over a two-hour period before dawn on March 23. They termed the killings “a full-fledged war crime” and called on the United Nations Security Council and the international community to demand accountability and an independent investigation. The Israeli military, which hasadmitted to killingthe 15 men, said on Monday that a “preliminary inquiry indicated that the troops opened fire due to a perceived threat following a previous encounter in the area,” and it would continue investigating. It said that six of those killed “were identified as Hamas terrorists,” but cited no evidence. The Red Crescent and the United Nations have said that the dead were unarmed aid workers who posed no threat. They said the men were wearing their uniforms and riding in clearly marked emergency vehicles, flashing their emergency lights. An Israeli military officialwho briefed reporterson the incident on Saturday declined to say whether the men were armed. Also on Monday, an Israeli strike near a hospital in southern Gaza killed two people, including a journalist for the Palestine Today news agency, bringing the number of Palestinian journalists killed in the war to 210, Gaza’s government press office said. It said the strike also wounded nine journalists, including Hassan Aslih, well-known for documenting the war for hundreds of thousands of social media followers. Israel’s military said Mr. Aslih was its target. Without citing evidence, it called him a Hamas militant who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on Israel, and “operates under the guise of a journalist.”The March 23 killing of rescue workers followed an airstrike on a home in the al-Hashasheen area of southern Gaza. A Red Crescent ambulance responded and was hit by Israeli gunfire, according to the aid group. When a convoy of emergency vehicles — including two more Red Crescent ambulances, as well as an ambulance and a fire truck from Gaza’s Civil Defense service — arrived to rescue the first ambulance, Israeli troops fired again, in a five-minute-long barrage. Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, the Palestine Red Crescent Society’s president, said the Israeli troops had set up an “ambush” for the convoy. Israeli forces then shot at a fourth Red Crescent ambulance that came to help the others, Red Crescent officials said. A worker on the field security team for the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees was among those killed, according to an agency spokeswoman, Tamara Alrifai. The attack on the convoy was captured in a video the Red Crescent said was later discovered on the cellphone of one of the paramedics who was killed. The New York Timespublished that videolast week. Red Crescent officials released a longer, 19-minute version of the video on Monday, showing worried paramedics, moments before they were shot, searching for their missing co-workers. The men’s bodies werefounda week later, when, after repeated requests, the United Nations and the Red Crescent secured permission from the Israeli military to search for them. On Monday, the Red Crescent said that all but one of the bodies were discovered piled together in a black mesh bag and buried “in a brutal and degrading manner that violates human dignity.”Preliminary autopsies showed multiple gunshot wounds to the upper parts of the men's bodies, Dr. Al-Khatib said at the news conference. Members of the Palestine Red Crescent and other emergency services carry bodies of fellow rescue workers killed a week earlier by Israeli forces, during a funeral procession in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on March 31. The video released on Monday, shows the convoy racing down dark roads to rescue the ambulance that had disappeared. The man who recorded it, identified as Rifaat Radwan, a Red Crescent paramedic, is heard praying repeatedly that his co-workers are alive and asking God to protect them. As his ambulance barrels down a road lit only by its headlights, Mr. Radwan says to the driver, “We’re calling their phones and no one is answering.” Naming the three missing colleagues, he says, “Ezzedine usually answers, and so do Mustafa and Munther.”The ambulance pulls up next to another ambulance, and after some discussion about where to find the missing ambulance, the two crews join a convoy that includes the Civil Defense ambulance and fire truck. Someone tells Mr. Radwan to stop recording. “These moments need to be documented,” he replies. “Oh Lord, let them be OK May the injuries be minor.”A little while later, the convoy comes upon the missing ambulance, a white shape beside the road. The vehicles stop, and some of the paramedics get out. Then staccato gunfire can be heard for about five minutes, mingled with Mr. Radwan’s desperate prayers. At one point, he addresses his mother. “Forgive me, Mom, forgive me,” he says. “I swear I only chose this path to help others.”His last words before the video ends: “The Israeli soldiers are coming, the Israeli soldiers are coming.”A grieving woman is comforted as she mourns the medics killed in the Israeli attack on the rescuers.

"Already Ravaged by War, Myanmar Now Longs for Earthquake Relief",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-aid.html,2025-04-07T14:54:59Z,World,Critics say the country’s often-incompetent military government has delayed and restricted the arrival and distribution of crucial aid.,"Myanmar Earthquake (March 28, 2025); War and Armed Conflicts; Earthquakes; Humanitarian Aid; Disasters and Emergencies",,Mandalay (Myanmar); Naypyidaw (Myanmar); Yangon (Myanmar); Myanmar,,"People searched through the debris of destroyed buildings in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Monday. Already Ravaged by War, Myanmar Now Longs for Earthquake ReliefCritics say the country’s often-incompetent military government has delayed and restricted the arrival and distribution of crucial aid. Seven days after an earthquakedevastated Turkeyin 2023, French volunteers used a suitcase-size radar to locate a survivor under the rubble. It was one of many lives the device helped save in the aftermath of the disaster. The group also rushed volunteers to Myanmar after apowerful earthquakelast month leveled buildings, bridge and centuries-old temples. But the volunteers were stuck at immigration control at the airport in Yangon for more than a day. They finally entered the country last Wednesday, only to have the authorities declare search and rescue operations ending the next day. The volunteers returned home without finding a single survivor. Myanmar’s military government surprised many observers when it called for international assistance in response to the March 28 earthquake. It alsodeclared a cease-fireagainst rebels in a civil war that has consumed the nation. But less than two weeks after the calamity hit, aid groups and volunteers said, international relief is not reaching Myanmar’s beleaguered public as fast as it could. They blame the junta for delays and restrictions on distributing aid. Others cite a climate of fear — the military hasresumed airstrikeson rebel areas despite the cease-fire and on at least one occasion fired on aid workers. “Nothing was reasonable on the ground,” said Sezer Ozgan, a volunteer with the French nonprofit L’Espoir du peuple A.R.S.I. Alreadyravaged by war, Myanmar continues to reel from the earthquake, which people have been calling “earth’s anger.” The official death toll has surpassed 3,500 and many more have been injured. But the full extent of the devastation remains hard to assess because of damaged roads and toppled phone towers. Many rendered homeless and those too scared to return to their damaged houses are sleeping in the open. They are being rattled by regular aftershocks in the suffocating pre-monsoon heat, and have to line up for daily rations provided by local aid groups. One reason for the delay in bringing in aid is that the government itself is in disarray, with many buildings in the capital, Naypyidaw, damaged. But the military’s announcement that all assistance would be coordinated by it has left aid groups jittery. Relief organizations have long been subject to a fickle process of obtaining travel authorizations. A year after seizing power in 2021, the junta almost entirely drained a disaster management fund by redirecting it for agriculture initiatives. When Cyclone Nargis killed more than 130,000 people in 2008, an earlier coterie of ruling generals blocked emergency aid and infamously told aid groups that the survivors did not need their “chocolate bars” and could instead survive on “frogs and fish from ditches.”Ruled by one brutal military regime after another for decades, the people of Myanmar are quick to support one another. But for local volunteers, fear hangs in the air as much as grief. People waited at a food distribution point in Sagaing, Myanmar, on Thursday. Aid groups blamed Myanmar’s junta for delays in aid reaching earthquake survivors. Phoe Thar, a volunteer rescue worker in Mandalay, said he was working less at night after hearing that an acquaintance had been forcibly drafted by the military. “We want to help more,” he said, “but fear is holding us back.”Equality Myanmar, a human rights organization, said it had tracked almost 100 cases of forced conscription since the earthquake, calling the disaster an opportunity for the military to recruit troops. Kiran Verma, a volunteer from India, said he was delayed for hours with local volunteers at a military checkpoint the day after the earthquake. He said he left after three days in the quake zone, feeling “scared.”“I thought they would be welcoming anyone coming to rescue their people,” Mr. Verma, 40, said. To some critics, the military itself could be doing more to help. Ko Min Htet, a volunteer in Mandalay, said he had seen only few soldiers clearing bricks from public buildings. They should focus instead on helping people, he said: “Some soldiers and police sit at damaged sites, scrolling on their phones.”Some would-be volunteers are afraid to return to cities like Mandalay and Yangon, which suffered the worst of the earthquake. “We’re longing to be on the ground, to offer whatever help we can,” said Min Han, a physician who fled to rebel held territory after the coup, refusing to work as a civil servant under the junta. “But returning now would be like walking straight into a trap — we could be arrested or killed.”The junta’s motives are clear, said Richard Horsey, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. “Their first priority isregime survival,” he said, “not the well-being of the country and its people.” At the same time, he said, the junta’s response to the earthquake is marked by “chaos rather than malice.”Lynn Maung was sheltering in a tent with his three children near the moat of the historic Mandalay Palace. On Saturday, he was taken by surprise when torrential rains and winds swept the tent away. There had been no weather warning. “We can’t predict earthquakes, but we can predict rainfall,” he said. “The way the military junta is handling things is like trying to treat a cancer patient with castor oil.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

U.S. Visa Ban Adds to South Sudan’s Mounting Troubles,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/africa/south-sudan-visas-trump.html,2025-04-07T13:47:59Z,World,The Trump administration’s revocation of all visas held by South Sudanese nationals comes as the East African nation faces the threat of renewed war.,Visas; United States International Relations,"Rubio, Marco; Machar, Riek; Kiir Mayardit, Salva; Museveni, Yoweri; Landau, Christopher T (1963- )",South Sudan; Juba (South Sudan); Uganda,,"The international airport in South Sudan’s capital, Juba. The Trump administration has not said whether it would seek to deport South Sudanese nationals whose visas had been revoked. U.S. Visa Ban Adds to South Sudan’s Mounting TroublesThe Trump administration’s revocation of all visas held by South Sudanese nationals comes as the East African nation faces the threat of renewed war. The Trump administration’s decision over the weekend torevoke visas for all South Sudanese passport holdershas added to the mounting political and humanitarian challenges of a country on the brink of civil war, officials and observers said on Monday. Tensions between the two political leaders of South Sudan have escalated in recent weeks, especially after the authorities put the vice presidentunder house arrestin late March. Millions of people are also facing hunger, displacement and disease asviolence intensifiesand the United Statescuts aid. Observers say thesweeping visa banshows how Washington is retreating from South Sudan — a nation the United States helped bring into existence nearly 15 years ago — at a time of immense need. “A massive storm is forming over South Sudan, and the visa ban only adds to the anxiety people have about all that could go wrong,” said Daniel Akech, the senior South Sudan analyst at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization. On Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was revoking visas for South Sudanese nationals and preventing any more from entering the United States. The deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, said onsocial mediathat South Sudan had refused to accept the repatriation of one of its nationals. The Trump administration has not said whether it would seek to deport South Sudanese nationals whose visas had been revoked. South Sudan’s government has not responded to the announcement of the visa ban, and a government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. South Sudan sends relatively few travelers to the United States. Just 46 nonimmigrant visas were issued to its nationals in January, compared with more than 2,500 to people from neighboring Kenya,according to U.S. government dataSunday Mass at a Catholic church in Juba last year. The visa cancellations come amid deepening political rifts between President Salva Kiir and his vice president, Riek Machar. The schism threatens the fragile 2018 peace agreement ending a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people and displaced millions. In recent months, the Sudanese military and opposition forces allied with Mr. Machar have clashed outside Juba, the capital, and in other parts of the country. In March, a U.N. helicopter evacuating wounded soldiers from Upper Nile State in the northeast wasattacked, resulting in the death of a general, several military officers and a crew member. The violence in the state has uprooted tens of thousands of people, some of whom have fled into Ethiopia, according to the United Nations. Uganda’s government has deployed troops to South Sudan at the request of President Kiir, a move that incensed Mr. Machar and his allies. Regional diplomatic efforts to quell the discord havefailed so far, raising fears of a potential collapse of the government. U.S. aid cuts are also hurting efforts to rebuild after years of conflict. The United Statesspent$705 million on food, health, education and other programs in the country last year. But much of that funding has vanished since the Trump administration came to power, aid groups say, forcing them to scale back programs responding to floods, cholera outbreaks and food shortages. “South Sudan is quickly becoming the forgotten crisis of the world,” Denish Ogenrwot, the advocacy lead for the aid agency Action Against Hunger, said by telephone from Juba. South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, left, and its vice president, Riek Machar, in 2019. They are now bitterly at odds. Mr. Akech of the International Crisis Group said the sudden visa revocations could disrupt the lives of South Sudanese nationals in the United States. Many of those people are students or individuals working to support families back home or in refugee camps, Mr. Akech said. They also include rising stars like Khaman Maluach, a basketball player whorepresented South Sudan at the Olympicslast year and just finished his freshman season asa center for Duke UniversityMr. Akech said the visa revocations should have targeted those responsible for worsening the situation in South Sudan, not the broader population. “The pain will be felt by those who should not be punished,” he said. South Sudanese opposition officials in the United States said on Monday that they were worried about the people who could be deported. “We are gravely concerned that individuals who are repatriated may face severe harm or even death at the hands of the very government responsible for these failures,” Reath Muoch Tang, a Washington-based senior official in Mr. Machar’s party who is a legal permanent resident of the United States, said in a statement to The New York Times. Future U.S. action, he said, should “focus on promoting accountability among leaders while safeguarding the lives and interests of ordinary South Sudanese citizens.”Displaced South Sudanese in a camp on the outskirts of Juba in February.

Putin Calls N.H.L. Star’s Record-Setting Goal a Reason for Russia to CelebrateAlex Ovechkin’s feat put a fresh spotlight on the hockey star’s past support for Russia’s leader and on his stance on the war in Ukraine. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia congratulated the hockey player Alex Ovechkin on Monday for breaking the N.H.L.’s goal-scoring record. Mr. Ovechkin, 39, captain of the Washington Capitals,scored his 895th career goalon Sunday afternoon in a game against the New York Islanders. That broke a record set by Wayne Gretzky that hadstood for 26 years. In a statement on Monday,Mr. Putin praised Mr. Ovechkin,who started out as a professional hockey player in Moscow, for the “momentous achievement” that he called  “a genuine cause for celebration for fans in Russia and beyond.”The sports feat — and the comments from the Kremlin — have put a fresh spotlight on Mr. Ovechkin’spast support for Mr. Putinand on the hockey star’s stance on the war in Ukraine. Mr. Ovechkin, who has played for the Washington Capitals since 2005, has lived in the United States for the past two decades. But his Instagram profile photo shows him with Mr. Putin, and in 2017, he started asocial media movement called #PutinTeam, months before Russia’s elections. The hockey star also raised eyebrows in 2022 when he failed to issue an outright condemnation of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. When asked about it at a news conference, Mr. Ovechkin said, “Please, no more war.” In response to a question about whether he still supported Mr. Putin, Mr. Ovechkin said,“He’s my president,”but added, “I am not in politics. I’m an athlete.”In his postgame remarks on Sunday, Mr. Ovechkin celebrated the achievement with a flurry of gratitude for his fellow players — and said, “Russia, we did it!”On Monday, Russian state television celebrated the athlete as “our pride, a Russian hockey player who made history,” drawing “admiration on both sides of the Atlantic.”Pro-Putin pundits were quick to seize on Mr. Ovechkin’s achievements after the record-setting goal. “Ovechkin has showed many times he is not afraid and not ashamed of being Russian, even when Russians have been bullied for being Russian,” Sergei Markov, a political scientist with links to the Kremlin,wrote on social media. “This is another thing that everyone in Russia is grateful to Ovechkin for, as well as the respect he has won in the world — not just for the hockey.”Mr. Ovechkin has not competed for Russia internationally since 2019, and the Russian national team has been banned from global competitions by the International Ice Hockey Federation since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Europe Gears Up to Make Its First Countermove to Trump Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/europe/europe-tariffs-trump-response.html,2025-04-07T10:32:14Z,World,"European Union officials will vet and vote on a list of retaliatory tariffs this week, while contemplating what comes next.",International Trade and World Market; Customs (Tariff); United States International Relations; International Relations,"Trump, Donald J",Europe,European Union,"Parts of BMW car bodies emerging from a machine at a plant in Munich. Auto manufacturing is Germany’s largest industry, and the United States is the sector’s biggest export market. Reporting from BelgiumEurope Gears Up to Make Its First Countermove to Trump TariffsEuropean Union officials will vet and vote on a list of retaliatory tariffs this week, while contemplating what comes next. European Union officials are taking a two-part approach to President Trump’s unfolding trade war, offering to slash tariffs on American-made cars and industrial products even as they prepare to retaliate imminently with wide-ranging levies. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the E.U.’s executive branch, said on Monday that the 27-nation bloc would be willing to employ a “zero-for-zero” approach on products including cars, eliminating tariffs on the goods if the United States did the same. E.U. car tariffs are currently set at 10 percent. But at the same time, both she and the E.U. trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, made it clear that European officials were preparing to deploy tariffs and, potentially, other trade barriers to hit back at the United States if the two sides could not reach a deal. Those tariffs are set to begin within days. European Union officials circulated on Monday evening in Brussels a list of products that they plan to hit with retaliatory tariffs, said Olof Gill, trade spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch. Representatives from across the bloc’s member states are expected to vote on that list on Wednesday. If approved, the fresh tariffs would take force in two waves — one on April 15, the second a month later. Officials did not immediately make the list public. The tariffs would mark the E.U.’s first concrete reaction to Mr. Trump’s volley of recent trade measures. They would specifically respond to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs that took effect in mid-March, and officials have said they would be only a first step. European policymakers are contemplating how to react to Mr. Trump’s subsequent moves, including his 25 percent tariffs on automobiles and the20 percentacross-the-board tariff on E.U. goods that he announced last week. The bloc’s first set of retaliatory tariffs was expected to be sweeping, though somewhat dialed back from what was originally planned. Officials had initially intended to hit about $28.4 billion worth of goods, and their preliminary list included imports like bourbon, boats, clothing and farm products. But a senior E.U. officialsuggested on Mondaythat bourbon might be dropped — it had emerged as a flashpoint after Mr. Trump threatened 200 percent tariffs on European wine and other alcohol in response. Mr. Sefcovic, the trade commissioner, said that the final tally of goods targeted would be smaller, after feedback from European member states. Still, Europe’s gamble on simultaneously employing carrots and sticks to prod the Trump administration toward the negotiating table could have big reverberations for the world economy. If a deal is struck, it could foster more unrestrained trade flows between two of the world’s largest markets and most important trading partners. If the conflict instead leads to escalating tension and worsening relations, it could help fuel a trade war that causes painful fallout for consumers and companies on both sides of the Atlantic. “We are fully prepared to sit at the negotiation table whenever our American partners are ready,” Mr. Sefcovic said on Monday in Luxembourg. He had what he described asa “frank” two-hour meetingwith his American counterparts late last week. “While the E.U. remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not wait,” he added. “We are prepared to use every tool in our trade defense arsenal.”The Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville, Ky., last month. The European Union’s preliminary list of retaliatory tariffs included duties on bourbon. European officials are cognizant that an all-out trade war could be painful on both sides of the Atlantic. “They have played it smart thus far by not getting dragged into an escalatory spiral,” said Jorn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, explaining that for Europe part of the game is waiting until the pain of trade disruptions begin to bite in the United States, while showing a willingness to react with strength. Officials took time to edit the first set of retaliatory lists because they wanted to take into account feedback from across the continent. Part of the list was originally meant to take hold on March 31. Itwas instead delayedfor further refinement after Mr. Trump threatened his200 percent tariffon all European alcohol. Such a move would be crushing for French and Italian winemakers, and policymakers from those countries voiced alarm. Whiskey, which triggered that response, is now expected by many to be dropped from the final list. Stéphane Séjourné, an executive vice president of the European Commission, said duringa radio interviewon Monday that he hoped for the “good news” that it would be cut. The episode underscored the challenge in maintaining a firm and united front in responding to tariffs. Countries across the continent have different economic priorities and different appetites for hitting back at the United States. Some Northern European countries have been adamant that the European Union must be forceful in its response — even pushing for the E.U. to use a powerful new trade tool to erect trade barriers on services, potentially targeting big American technology companies like Google. But other European leaders have been more reluctant to hit back so hard. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has called the idea that Italy must choose between the United States and the bloc “childish.” She has alsocautioned againstharsh retaliation. Two workers treating vineyards for weeds last month outside Épernay, France. European winemakers are concerned about potential damage to their export business. Officials from across the 27-member bloc have been united on one point: They would like to negotiate. But part of the challenge is that the United States has shown little appetite for a quick deal. American officials seem to view the tariffs “not as a tactical step, but as a corrective,” Mr. Sefcovic said on Monday. Nor are the ultimate goals entirely clear. Elon Musk, the technology entrepreneur and Mr. Trump’s close adviser,said on Saturday, speaking during a videoconference appearance with Italy’s far-right League party in Florence. that he hoped that Europe and the United States would move “to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone.”But Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, on Mondayurged the European Unionto drop its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat that is produced with hormones or other chemicals. “You steal from the American people every which way is possible,” he said. “So don’t just say we’re going to lower our tariffs.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

"In Odesa, Many Wonder About the Benefits of a Black Sea Cease-Fire With Russia",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/europe/ukraine-russia-black-sea-truce.html,2025-04-07T09:01:57Z,World,Ukrainian Navy officers and business owners in the port city pondered what Kyiv could gain from a truce after it pushed back Russian vessels and resumed commercial shipping.,Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022); Peace Process; Ships and Shipping; Defense and Military Forces; Ports; Embargoes and Sanctions,,Black Sea; Odessa (Ukraine); Ukraine; Russia,,"Ukrainian sailors aboard a navy patrol boat on the Black Sea this month. Russia and Ukraine have said they are committed to stop fighting in the Black Sea, with caveats. Constant Méheut joined the Ukrainian Navy on a patrol mission in the Black Sea, near the southern city of Odesa, to report this article. In Odesa, Many Wonder About the Benefits of a Black Sea Cease-Fire With RussiaUkrainian Navy officers and business owners in the port city pondered what Kyiv could gain from a truce after it pushed back Russian vessels and resumed commercial shipping. The Ukrainian Navy patrol boat zipped across the Black Sea, its double-barreled, 25-millimeter machine gun locked on the horizon. The enemy, Russia, was nowhere in sight, yet ever-present. In the command room, Captain Mykhailo and his crew scanned screens showing color-coded zones marking Russian mine-laden waters and red arrows tracking drones prowling the area. The crew’s mission was to defend the waters off Odesa, Ukraine’s largest Black Sea port city, and keep them safe for commercial traffic. It has been grueling work — clearing Russian mines by day, shooting down drones by night — but after more than a year of patrols alongside other Ukrainian Navy vessels, they have succeeded. The Russian Navy has beenpushed far from Ukrainian shores, allowing Ukraine’s commercial shipping torebound to near prewar levels. On Tuesday, the fruits of Captain Mykhailo’s efforts materialized on the horizon: the silhouette of a 740-foot, Panama-flagged ship gliding toward a Ukrainian port to be loaded with grain. “Big ship. Nice,” said Captain Mykhailo, speaking on the condition that only his first name and rank be used, in keeping with Ukrainian military rules. Kyiv and Moscow committed toa cease-fire on the Black Sealast month during separate U.S.-mediated talks, but Ukraine’s military and commercial achievements in those waters have led many in Odesa to ponder this question: Does Ukraine have anything to gain from such a truce? Despite thecease-fire commitment, the countries are still negotiating whether or how it will come into force. And navy officers and business owners in Odesa have used the delay to weigh the deal’s pros and cons. A cease-fire could spare the ports from Russian drone and missile strikes, but it might also mean relinquishing Ukraine’s strategic advantage at sea, perhaps the only area of the battlefield where it holds the upper hand. “I don’t want a cease-fire,” said Tariel Khajishvili, the head of Novik LLC, a Ukrainian shipping agent operating in Odesa. “The only side that wants a cease-fire is Russia because they no longer control the Black Sea.”Ukraine’s skepticism has only deepened withMoscow’s conditions for a truce: the lifting of some Western economic sanctions and a return to a previous U.N.-backed deal that allowed Russia to control commercial ships leaving Ukrainian ports for weapons inspections — two demands that are non-starters for Kyiv. “Why should we make concessions now? We’ve effectively closed the Black Sea,” Pavlo Palisa, a senior military adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, told reporters last week, pointing to Kyiv’s success in pushing Russian ships out of key parts of the sea. Deep mistrust also persists between the countries. Both sides have agreed in principle to temporarily halt strikes against energy infrastructure,only to accuse each other of violations. It remains unclear if a cease-fire in the Black Sea will ever take effect. Ukrainian military officials have noted that Russia has refrained from attacking Ukrainian ports since last month’s talks, aligning with one of Kyiv’s main demands, but they caution that it is too soon to call it a truce. The Ukrainian Navy team using a U.S.-donated vessel that was later equipped with a twin-barreled, 25-millimeter machine gun to shoot down drones. That Ukraine can now afford to reject a cease-fire in the Black Sea speaks volumes about the drastic shift in fortunes there. Shortly after Russia launched itsfull-scale invasionthree years ago, its navy ships came within 15 miles of Ukraine’s coast, close enough to fire at it directly. Captain Mykhailo, 27, recalled a strike that “destroyed a reconnaissance station” on the southern outskirts of Odesa. In the city,residents filled sandbagsto fortify defensive positions, bracing for an assault. Russia never managed to breach Odesa. But its navy controlled enough of the Black Sea to blockade Ukrainian ports, choking the country’s economy andthreatening global food securitybecause Ukraine is a major grain exporter. A U.N.-brokered dealin July 2022 reopened a shipping corridor for Ukrainian exports, but only under a deal allowing Russia to inspect all commercial ships for weapons. Kyiv said Moscow deliberately slowed inspections to strangle trade. After a year, barely two dozen ships wereusing the corridor each monthRussiawithdrew from that deal in July 2023, complaining about the same economic sanctions it now seeks to have lifted, and threatened all commercial ships heading to and from Ukraine. To restart exports, Ukraine began a campaign to drive back Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, using sea drones and missiles to destroy or damage more than a quarter of its major warships,according to British defense intelligence services. The assaults forced Russia’s fleet to retreat to the eastern part of the sea, far from Ukrainian shores, allowing Ukraine tosecure a new shipping corridorthat hugs its coast before entering the territorial waters of NATO members. Captain Mykhailo said his patrol boat — an Island-class vesseldonated by the United States in 2021— accompanies commercial ships sailing off Ukrainian shores, “providing safety from the mines, from the air attacks of Russia.”More ships now travel through the new corridor than during the U.N.-backed agreement. Black Sea food exports are also nearing prewar levels. Last year, Ukraine shipped 42 million metric tons of grain and oilseed, roughly 80 percent of its prewar volume, according to data compiled by the Ukrainian investment firm Dragon Capital. Against that backdrop, experts see little benefit for Ukraine in a Black Sea cease-fire. Captain Mykhailo said he does not trust Russia to uphold a cease-fire. On a recent night, his crew tried to shoot down Russian drones flying over the Black Sea. “What kind of peace is that?” he said. A return to the U.N.-backed agreement, as requested by Russia, “may reverse all the success of the Ukrainian corridor secured by the Ukrainian military, especially if vessels’ inspections are reintroduced,” said Natalia Shpygotska, a senior analyst at Dragon Capital. “I can’t see why Ukraine should accept” that demand, she added. “It makes no sense.”All Ukraine could gain from a cease-fire would be an end to Russian strikes on its ports, experts say. Those attacks havedamaged several shipsand destroyed numerous containers and grain silos. At the peak of the assaults, in the second half of 2023, the export capacity of Odesa’s ports dropped by up to 20 percent, according to Yurii Vaskov, Ukraine’s former deputy minister of infrastructure. Capt. Dmytro Pletenchuk, a Ukrainian Navy spokesman, said that “for Ukraine, a cease-fire in the Black Sea primarily means stopping attacks on port infrastructure so that our grain corridor can operate without disruption.”“There is nothing more that Russia can offer us in this agreement,” he said during an interview in Odesa. That offer, however, was absent from the White House statementsannouncing the Black Sea cease-fire last monthAndrii Klymenko, the head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, said he did not expect the two sides to ever establish a maritime truce given their conflicting demands. He suspects that Russia wants to use the truce to move some of its ships back into the central part of the Black Sea, something Kyiv hasalready warnedwould prompt counterattacks. Back on Captain Mykhailo’s boat, a cease-fire feels as distant as ever. Iron boxes of machine-gun rounds sit ready to be used on the deck. On Tuesday night, the crew emptied several of them, firing at Russian drones streaking toward Odesa and its outskirts. “We unfortunately failed to bring them down,” Captain Mykhailo said, though none appeared to have hit the ports that night, according to the Ukrainian authorities. “For me, nothing changes,” he added. “It’s fighting as usual.”A vessel on the Black Sea this month. A cease-fire could spare ports from Russian strikes, but it might also mean relinquishing Ukraine’s strategic advantage at sea. Daria Mitiuk,Oleksandr ChubkoandMaria Varenikovacontributed reporting.

China Tries to Downplay the Trade War’s Effects on Its Economy,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/asia/china-trade-war-tariffs.html,2025-04-07T06:01:29Z,World,"Faced with economic disruption, Beijing is presenting itself as too powerful to succumb to U.S. pressure.

China Tries to Downplay the Trade War’s Effects on Its EconomyFaced with economic disruption, Beijing is presenting itself as too powerful to succumb to U.S. pressure. It is also censoring criticism at home. China’s leaders have sent a clear message about the effects of the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs: Things will be painful, but it is nothing that the country cannot handle. Acommentaryon Sunday in the Communist Party mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, said Beijing had prepared for a trade war with the United States and that China could potentially come out stronger as a result. “The abuse of tariffs by the United States will have an impact on China, but ‘the sky will not fall,’” it said. “China is a super economy. We are strong and resilient in the face of the U.S. tariff bullying.”The commentary highlighted how China hopes to position itself as the tariffs cause growing economic disruption. It wants to be seen as a responsible champion of fair trade that is too powerful to succumb to U.S. pressure. China also sought to project solidarity with other nations targeted by U.S. tariffs in another state media commentary on Sunday. In that piece, China accused the United States of trying to “subvert the existing international economic and trade order” by putting “U.S. interests above the common good of the international community.” Washington was also advancing “U.S. hegemonic ambitions at the cost of the legitimate interests of all countries,” it said. China’s projection of relative strength belies the grave harm the Trump administration’s tariffs could potentially inflict on the country. Mr. Trump is bidding to transform a global trading system that China currently dominates. And exports remain the strongest engine for growth at a time when China is trying to dig itself out of a property crisis and tackle other major economic problems. Despite that, the People’s Daily commentary argued that China was prepared to weather Mr. Trump’s tariffs because it was no longer as reliant on the U.S. market for its exports. It also said China’s banks were well capitalized and had room to inject more money into the domestic economy. And it argued that it can hit back at the United States with an array of new regulatory tools. Some of those tools were used on Friday when Chinaresponded to Mr. Trump’s tariffsby putting 11 American companies on an unreliable entities list, and another 16 on an export control list. It also announced export controls on medium and heavy rare earths. That was in addition to slapping U.S. goods with tariffs of 34 percent to match duties imposed on Chinese goods. China has been trying for months to engage in high-level talks with the Trump administration in preparation for a potential summit between Mr. Trump and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping. But Beijing has struggled to receive much of a response from the White House despite Mr. Trump saying earlier this year that he was open to engaging with Mr. Xi. China’s responses totwo other roundsof 10 percent tariffs imposed by the United States earlier this year were calibrated to leave the door open for negotiations. Some analysts said Friday’s countermeasures were also designed that way. The People’s Daily commentary said China “did not close the door for negotiations,” but that it would also prepare for the worst. It said the looming crisis would compel China to continue reforming its economy to rely more on its vast domestic market. “We must turn pressure into motivation,” it said. For all its bravado about withstanding the American tariffs, China was also censoring criticisms of its own move to impose retaliatory tariffs. On Friday, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote on social media that China’s countermeasures were “completely wrong.”“The United States is shooting itself in the foot by tariffs, so we should not shoot ourselves in the foot as well,” wrote the researcher, He Bin, who was deputy director of the academy’s Center for Public Policy Research. “The correct countermeasure is to implement unilateral zero tariffs on imports from all countries.”Mr. He posted the comment on his personal WeChat Moments, which are visible only to his friends and somewhat akin to a private Facebook page. But a screenshot of the post quickly began circulating more widely. Then, on Sunday, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciencesannounced that it was shutting downthe center where Mr. He worked. It did not give a reason for the closure but cited internal regulations around the management of research centers. Those regulations statethat centers, among other things, “must adhere to the correct political direction.”Screenshots of Mr. He’s comment were also grayed out on Weibo, another social media platform. The center may already have been under intense scrutiny: Its director, Zhu Hengpeng, was detained and removed from his posts last year after allegedly making comments critical of Mr. Xi in a private group chat,The Wall Street Journal reportedin September. On Chinese social media, nationalist commentators cheered the center’s closure and linked it to Mr. He’s comments. “Resolutely support the spirit of the central government’s directive!”wrote a military bloggerwith 4 million followers on Weibo.

Reporting from Phnom Penh, CambodiaIn a Strongman State, a Trump Order Extinguishes Flickers of FreedomCambodia’s authoritarian dynasty had silenced almost all of the country’s independent media. The remaining few are facing extinction because of an executive directive from President Trump. His father was marched to a forest and killed, like so many victims of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Before he was led away, the father told his young son, Uon Chhin, to stand up and speak the truth, even if it might compromise his liberty. Decades later, Mr. Uon Chhin became a journalist during the muckraking heyday of the free press in Cambodia. But in 2017, he and a colleague at Radio Free Asia were charged with espionage. Their nine-month imprisonment presaged an evisceration of human rights in Cambodia byHun Sen, the longtime leader who refashioned a young democracy into a dictatorial dynasty. Now, the slashing of American foreign aid and President Trump’s executive order last month togut American-funded news medialike Radio Free Asia and Voice of America are erasing what little space for free speech remains in Cambodia. Thirty projects funded by the United States Agency for International Development have been canceled, including those supporting civil society and an independent media. It is a tectonic shift in this Southeast Asian nation, which was once a laboratory for internationally mandated democracy-building in the post-Khmer Rouge era, then later devolved into a strongman state. And it underscores the rise of another power, China, eager to influence a small country desperate for cash and for a model for developing its fast-growing economy. Like China, Mr. Hun Sen celebrated Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. Silencing these American-funded news organizations, he said, would be “a major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement, and chaos around the world.”Hun Sen, left, and his son, Hun Manet, in Phnom Penh last year. Two years ago, Mr. Hun Sen nominally handed over power to his oldest son, Hun Manet. Educated at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Mr. Hun Manet hasnot changed course. (The transfer of power from father to son has been replicated for the positions of defense minister, chief of the navy and interior minister.)Today, almost every independent media outlet in Cambodia has been shuttered, although some, like Radio Free Asia, still operate from outside the country. Political parties have been dissolved by a pliant judiciary. Hundreds of Cambodians who decried the country’s autocratic turn are in prison or in exile. In January, aveteran opposition politician was assassinatedon the streets of Bangkok, a hit that the Thai policelinked to anadviser to Mr. Hun Sen. “In Cambodia, RFA is the last independent media outlet operating in Khmer,” said Bay Fang, the broadcaster’s president, referring to the local language service, which has eight million Facebook followers. “If we close down, the ruling party gets to completely control the narrative. It’s no wonder that Hun Sen celebrated the news of RFA’s possible demise.”After his release from prison, Mr. Uon Chhin eventually found work at a news collective formed by outcasts of other shuttered media outlets. Half of the group’s annual budget of $810,000 came from American aid. The collective, calledCamboJA, only has enough money to operate until June. They have stopped providing drinking water at the office to save $30 a month. “My colleagues and I, we know that something like this happens in Cambodia all the time, but we never expected it to happen from America,” Mr. Uon Chhin said. “It’s like Cambodia and America have traded places.”The offices of Radio Free Asia in Washington. An executive order by President Trump last month gutted American-funded news media like Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. There are Cambodian news outlets that make money. They eschew criticism of the Hun family and its cronies, including individuals who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for alleged corruption and human rights abuses. The most popular is called Fresh News, and it publishes online in Khmer, English and Chinese. Last year, the ruling Cambodian People’s Party, which is led by the Huns, ordered all officials to use the Fresh News messaging service, CoolApp, rather than foreign options like WhatsApp or Signal. “Cambodia has complete freedom, more than some countries in the region,” said Lim Cheavutha, founder and chief executive of Fresh News, which is the ruling party’s preferred mouthpiece for disseminating information. As the United States and other Western nations, like Sweden, withdraw funding for independent media and democratic institutions, China has stepped in with money that it says is not tied to pesky human rights concerns. Last summer, Heng Sreylin, 25, traveled with other Cambodian journalists and influencers on an all-expenses paid junket to northeast China. She marveled at the modern buildings and clean streets. She produced 20 tourism and culture stories from her trip. “We don’t have freedom of expression in Cambodia,” said Ms. Heng Sreylin, who works for a small outlet that focuses on things like travel stories and celebrity news. “I do stories that don’t bring problems to me. I don’t want to touch politics.”Journalists covering the shut down of Voice of Democracy, an independent news outlet, in 2023. Independent journalists have been absorbed into government. The information minister, Neth Pheaktra, was once an editor at a respected daily publication that uncovered corruption, political malfeasance and oligarchs acting badly. He now glorifies the Hun dynasty, and in an interview in his expansive office filled with trees and gilded accouterments, the minister listed flattering facts about Mr. Hun Manet. “Our prime minister himself, he monitors TikTok and social media and Facebook,” he said. “Sometimes he reads the comments from the local people on his phone.”Mr. Neth Pheaktra said he could not answer questions about the media crackdown that shuttered dozens of outlets in Cambodia because that happened before he became information minister in 2023. Soy Sopheap worked for a Japanese news agency before veering into pro-government political punditry. He is now the Cambodian co-president of the Cambodia-China Journalist Association, which organizes the media tours to China. (He said he does not know who his Chinese co-president is exactly, nor why he was chosen for the job.)At the group’s founding, a diplomat from the Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, celebrated the advent of “promoting positive news about our two countries.”“Human rights are words that the West likes to use,” Mr. Soy Sopheap said. “But China is a dependable friend to Cambodia.”Ith Sothoeuth has lost U.S. funding for his new journalistic startup, an online news site. His previous employer, Voice of Democracy, was forced off the airwaves in 2023. He doesn’t know how he will continue without American support, and he isn’t sure he will avoid prison. But, he said, he will continue standing up for free expression. “If you go with the flow, you are a dead fish,” he said. “If you fight the current, it means you are alive.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Eyewitnesses Recount Deadly Israeli Attack on Medics in Gaza,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/middleeast/gaza-medics-killed-israel.html,2025-04-06T21:07:47Z,World,"The New York Times interviewed two people who described being detained by Israeli soldiers and looking on as they opened fire on ambulances and a fire truck, killing 15.",Civilian Casualties; Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); Humanitarian Aid,,Israel; Gaza Strip; Rafah (Gaza Strip),International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; United Nations," Vivian Yee reported from Cairo, and Bilal Shbair from al-Mawasi, Gaza, where he interviewed both witnesses. Eyewitnesses Recount Deadly Israeli Attack on Medics in GazaThe New York Times interviewed two people who described being detained by Israeli soldiers and looking on as they opened fire on ambulances and a fire truck, killing 15. It was still dark out when a group of ambulances and a fire truck dispatched by Palestinian emergency response services slowed to a halt in Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, early on March 23. They had been sent to find their paramedic colleagues, who had headed out in an ambulance on a rescue mission earlier that morning before disappearing. Now the convoy stopped next to the missing ambulance, which stood by the side of the road near some U.N. warehouses. When paramedics got out to look, Israeli soldiers about 50 meters away opened fire on them, according to two men who said they had witnessed the shootings. The two men saw what happened, they said, because they were being held by the same Israeli troops. One of the two, Munther Abed, 27, a volunteer paramedic, said he had been detained after surviving an earlier attack on the missing ambulance that killed two other crew members. The other man, Dr. Saeed al-Bardawil, 55, a physician, said he had been detained alongside Mr. Abed when he and his son were stopped by Israeli troops on their way to go fishing about 4:45 a.m. The New York Times interviewed the two men separately in Gaza days after the United Nations said it had found the bodies of 15 rescue workers — eight from the Palestine Red Crescent Society, six from Gaza’s Civil Defense and one from the United Nations — in a mass grave. Their ambulances, their fire truck and a U.N. vehicle, which had been crushed, were half-buried nearby. The United Nations hasaccused Israelof killing the 15 workers, discarding their bodies and destroying the vehicles. The two men’s accounts appear to support those accusations. Although their stories could not be independently confirmed, the details they gave also matched the sequence of events in avideo obtained and verified by The New York Times, discovered on the cellphone of one of the dead paramedics. That video shows an intense barrage of gunfire hitting the convoy just as dawn breaks. Munther Abed, a volunteer paramedic, said he survived an Israeli attack on his ambulance. “I wasn’t blindfolded — I saw everything clearly,” Dr. al-Bardawil said. “The medics got out to inspect the damaged ambulance. That’s when the soldiers opened heavy fire.”The video and the witnesses’ accounts contradict the Israeli military’sinitial explanationfor the attack, which was that its forces had opened fire on the emergency vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals. The video shows that the ambulances and fire truck were clearly marked and flashing their emergency lights. Mr. Abed and Dr. al-Bardawil also said the vehicles’ headlights and emergency signals had been on and that they had stopped when the shooting began. The killings have drawn international condemnation and scrutiny. On Saturday, an Israeli military officialtold reportersthat the military’s initial version of events had been partly “mistaken.” The military said in a statement on Sunday that the episode was “under thorough examination.”Speaking anonymously under Israeli military rules, the military official said that Israeli officials believed that at least six of the 15 dead had been Hamas operatives, but did not provide any evidence. The official declined to comment on whether any of those killed had been armed. Mr. Abed, the paramedic who described the attack, said he had been a volunteer with the Red Crescent in Gaza since 2015, working in his hometown, Rafah. He also owns a bookshop, he said. Red Crescent jobs have been something of a family tradition: his father is a Red Crescent manager; his brother Mohammed, 25, also worked for the humanitarian agency until he was killed in a drone strike in May 2024. In the predawn hours the day of the attack, Mr. Abed recalled, his ambulance crew was dispatched to help evacuate civilians after an Israeli attack in Rafah. Gazans who fled Rafah arriving in Khan Younis on the day of the ambulance attack. As they drew nearer, Mr. Abed suddenly heard a barrage of shots hitting the ambulance, he said. Everything died instantly: the interior lights, the siren, the engine. Then he heard a sound he knew from experience — a death rattle, he called it — coming from his two colleagues in the front. One was a fellow paramedic, Ezzedine Shaath, and the other was the driver, Mostafa Khafaja. Outside the ambulance, he could hear people speaking Hebrew, he said. Certain he was about to die, Mr. Abed began reciting the Shahada, a Muslim declaration of faith. Then Israeli soldiers opened the door, and someone ordered him to strip naked and kneel, Mr. Abed said. The soldiers began hitting him on the back with the butts of their rifles, he said. They spit on him, cursed him and questioned him, he said, asking where he was on Oct. 7, 2023, the date of the Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the war. “You’re a terrorist — why are you here?” one soldier shouted, Mr. Abed recalled. Mr. Abed said they pushed him backward and pressed a rifle into his neck so hard he thought he might suffocate. One soldier held a knife just next to his wrist, he said. The Israeli military official said that soldiers had killed two Hamas operatives and detained a third from the initial ambulance. He did not explain why, if Mr. Abed was an operative, he was later released. Shortly after Mr. Abed was detained, two new people joined him in handcuffs: Dr. al-Bardawil, a general practitioner, and his 12-year-old son, Mohammed, who were stopped by soldiers as they headed to the beach to fish, which Dr. al-Bardawil loved to do. Whenever a car approached, Dr. al-Bardawil recalled, the Israeli soldiers lay flat on the ground and ordered the detainees to follow suit. The soldiers did not fire at any of those vehicles, he said. Soon after the al-Bardawils were detained, Dr. al-Bardawil and Mr. Abed said, the men saw emergency vehicles approaching. Mr. Abed recognized a fire truck and an ambulance from Gaza’s Civil Defense. Mr. Abed with his mother, Somaya Abed, and father, Jehad Abed. An Israeli officer was talking to soldiers in Hebrew nearby, Mr. Abed said, and as soon as he finished speaking, the soldiers opened fire on the vehicles. The shooting lasted for several minutes, he said. As more red emergency lights approached, Mr. Abed was told to move to a place where his view was blocked — and then heard more gunfire, he said. Dr. al-Bardawil, who described still having a direct sightline, said the Israelis had been firing at oncoming ambulances. As the sun rose, around 20 Israeli tanks and around 100 Israeli soldiers arrived on the scene, Mr. Abed said, and dug four large holes in the ground. Satellite images from this time obtained by The Times showed the four ambulances and Civil Defense truck clumped together toward the side of the road, next to where they were later buried. Three bulldozers, an excavator and Israeli tanks were nearby. When it was fully light, he said, he saw an Israeli bulldozer, which he identified as a Caterpillar D9, crushing five ambulances and the fire truck and pushing them into one of the holes. He also saw a crumpled U.N. vehicle, he said. Dr. al-Bardawil said he witnessed the bulldozer plowing the bodies into the ground along with the vehicles. The Israeli military officer said that the soldiers had buried the bodies to protect them from wild animals and that they had used heavy equipment to push the vehicles to clear the road. Palestine Red Crescent members and other emergency service workers with the remains of fellow rescuers killed by Israeli forces at a funeral procession in Khan Younis on March 31. Mr. Abed said he was relieved when the Israelis brought another Red Crescent paramedic, Asaad al-Nasasra,  still alive, over to the group of detainees. In handcuffs and a blindfold, Mr. al-Nasasra whispered to him what he knew about their colleagues, Mr. Abed recalled. Two looked wounded, one of them seriously, he said Mr. al-Nasasra told him. And last he had seen them, Mr. al-Nasasra recalled, two others were reciting the Shahada. One Israeli soldier sounded triumphant when Mr. Abed asked about the other ambulance workers, he recalled. “Your colleagues — all of them are gone!” he told him, mockingly, in broken Arabic, the paramedic said. “May God have mercy on their souls,” Mr. Abed recalled replying. Another soldier told him, also in broken Arabic, that God had taken “those terrorists” to hell. Eventually, the soldiers led Mr. al-Nasasra, the other paramedic, away. He is still missing, according to the Red Crescent. That afternoon, Dr. al-Bardawil and Mr. Abed said they were asked to help the soldiers by telling a large group of civilians who had gathered in the area to evacuate the area. After they did so, they were released, they said. Hurrying away, Mr. Abed left his jacket, ID card and bank card behind. His parents had been panicking since they heard about the attacks. “Reassure me you’re OK, dear son,” his mother, Somaya Abed, 49, had texted him at 7:52 a.m. that day, according to a message she showed a New York Times reporter. There was no reply until Mr. Abed was released around 4 p.m. He called his father right away. “I’m finally out and safe,” the younger Mr. Abed said. But after hours of repeated beatings, he could barely walk, he said. A Red Crescent vehicle had to bring him home. Mr. Abed did not believe he would survive the attack, he said.

Reporting from ParisDefiant, Le Pen Tells Supporters ‘I Won’t Give Up’ Despite  5-Year BanIn a speech, Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, cast a judicial decision prohibiting her from running for office as a threat to democracy. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, told cheering supporters in Paris on Sunday that she would fightthe five-year ban on her running for office, which resulted from an embezzlement conviction, casting herself as an underdog representing those who are “disdained” by the political elite. Addressing a crowd of several thousand who chanted her name, Ms. Le Pen and her allies railed against what they called curtailed free speech, biased judges and a “system” built to keep their party out of power. This is happening, she said, as the country disintegrates into “ruin and chaos.”“I won’t give up,” Ms. Le Pen said, arguing that she was the target of a politically motivated “witch hunt” to prevent her from competing in France’s 2027 presidential election, in which she has been a front-runner. “They are doing this for a single reason,” she said. “We are winning.”Ms. Le Pen’s conviction has been criticized by global right-wing figures, includingPresident Trump. Her criticisms of France’s judiciary echoed his grievances against American courts. But she was less fiery in tone than Mr. Trump often is, and the crowd did not course withthe volatile anger that fueled the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol in Washington. Her party, the National Rally, has spent more than a decade working to replace its radical image with a smooth, ready-to-govern one. Ms. Le Pen even invoked the spirit of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as she urged a “peaceful and democratic resistance” against the judicial action directed at her. She said that she was not “above the law, but not below it,” either. “Despite our opponents’ delusions, there is no spirit of sedition among us,” she insisted, speaking from a podium emblazoned with the words “Let’s save democracy.”Gathered before the gleaming golden dome of the Invalides, under which Napoleon’s remains are entombed, many older supporters waving French flags said they believed the sentence was heavy-handed and unfair. But few seethed with fury, and the demonstration felt more like an early campaign rally than a heated protest. Supporters of Ms. Le Pen at the rally. “I support Marine, even though she did something foolish,” said Jean-Louis Viardot, 74, a retired auto worker. “She should be punished, but the sentencing was too harsh.”Ms. Le Pen, and 23 other people affiliated with the National Rally party, were convicted on embezzlement charges last week. The caseinvolved her party’s misuse of over 4.4 million euros, or about $4.8 million, in European Parliament funds between 2004 and 2016. She was sentenced to four years in prison — two of those were suspended, two are to be served under a form of house arrest — and fined €100,000. She was also barred from competing for public office for five years. Ms. Le Pen has run for president in each of the last three races, making it to the second round against President Emmanuel Macron in 2017 and 2022. Her party is the single largest in the lower and more powerful house of Parliament. Ms. Le Pen appealed the verdict, and the Paris Court of Appeal said it expected to reach a decision by summer 2026. Should the ban be lifted, that would give her enough time to prepare for the presidential campaign. It is not unheard-of for French politicians convicted of corruption to be ruled ineligible, but barring a presidential front-runner is unprecedented. Some of Ms. Le Pen’s supporters suggested she was being unfairly singled out. A placard opposing Ms. Le Pen, as seen at the Paris rally on Sunday, says the law applies to all. “Everyone else did the same thing,” said Antoine Issa, 74, a retired public works employee from Ms. Le Pen’s constituency in northern France. Buses were chartered for supporters to travel to the protest. Ms. Issa pointed out that members of the centrist party of France’s prime minister,  François Bayrou, had been found guilty on similar charges, although it stood accused of embezzling far less. Mr. Bayrou, who unlike Ms. Le Pen was not found to have played a key role in the embezzlement,was acquitted. “Why didn’t they do the same thing against Bayrou?” Mr. Issa said. “Look where he is. He’s the prime minister. It’s painful to see that.”Jordan Bardella, 29, Ms. Le Pen’s protégé and the current party president, has been groomed for years to be prime minister if she wins France’s presidency. But the party has appeared reluctant to present him as a replacement for Ms. Le Pen in the 2027 race. On Sunday, he publicly reiterated his loyalty to her as leader. “We have a sacred duty to be there, to stand united behind Marine, to hold firm in the face of storms,” he told the crowd.  “She can count on me.”Jordan Bardella, the president of the National Rally party, told those attending its gathering Sunday that Ms. Le Pen had his unwavering support. Two additional competing political rallies were held on Sunday, after the verdict against Ms. Le Pen suddenly scrambled the 2027 presidential race. The first, by Mr. Macron’s centrist Renaissance party, had been scheduled before her conviction but was recast by party officials as a way to counter far-right attacks on the judiciary with a full-throated defense of the rule of law. The second was organized around a similar goal by the hard-left France Unbowed party and  the country’s Green party.

What We Know About the Case of Gaza Aid Workers Killed by Israeli Gunfire,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-workers-killed-israel.html,2025-04-06T17:29:08Z,World,"The Israeli military, confronted with video evidence contradicting its initial account, now says it was “mistaken.”",Israel-Gaza War (2023- ),,Gaza Strip; Israel; Rafah (Gaza Strip),American Red Cross; Hamas; International Committee of the Red Cross; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,"Members of the Palestine Red Crescent and other emergency services last Monday carrying the bodies of rescue workers killed a week earlier by Israeli forces in Gaza. Reporting from JerusalemWhat We Know About the Case of Gaza Aid Workers Killed by Israeli GunfireThe Israeli military, confronted with video evidence contradicting its initial account, now says it was “mistaken.”The Israeli military has acknowledged flaws in its initial accounts of its troops’ involvement in the killing last month of 15 people in southern Gaza who the United Nations said were all paramedics and rescue workers. The admission came on Saturday, the day aftera videoobtained by The New York Times appeared to contradict a key part of the military’s earlier version of events. While the military had said it fired on the vehicles after they “advanced suspiciously,” the video showed clearly marked ambulances and a fire truck. The episode has drawn international scrutiny and condemnation. After the blatant inconsistencies in the Israeli account were revealed, the military seemed to move more quickly than usual to address the issue. Internal military inquiries into questionable deadly episodes can drag on for months, even years. Here’s what we know so far: The Israeli military’s version(s)In its initial statements after the bodies were discovered, the military insisted its troops had opened fire as a convoy approached them in the dark “without headlights or emergency signals.”But the video — discovered on the cellphone of a paramedic who was found in a mass grave — shows that the ambulances and fire truck had emergency lights on as Israeli forces unleashed their barrage. The military now says the initial account from forces on the ground was “mistaken.”Military officials had previously asserted that nine of those killed were operatives of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. They had named only one of the nine and provided no evidence for their claim. On Saturday, a military official who briefed reporters on the initial findings of an internal inquiry said at least six of the 15 were Hamas operatives but still did not provide evidence. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity under army rules. Before the encounter with the emergency vehicles, the official said, reserve forces from an infantry brigade had been lying in ambush along a road to the north of the Gazan city of Rafah before dawn on March 23. At 4 a.m., they killed what the official described as two Hamas security personnel and detained a third. Two hours later, as dawn was breaking, the emergency convoy approached the same spot. When the rescue workers began to leave their vehicles, the official said, the Israeli forces believed that they were Hamas operatives heading for them and opened fire from afar. Amos Harel, a military affairs analyst for the left-leaning newspaper Haaretz, said in an interview that the soldiers had “good reason to be anxious” and that it would be wrong to assume immediately that the case was one of “murder in cold blood,” citing Hamas fighters’ frequent use of civilian infrastructure as cover. But the episode raises questions, Mr. Harel said, about the soldiers’ conduct and the version of events they reported from the ground. The military official denied reports that some of the bodies were found bound and shot at close range. He said that the troops had buried the bodies to shield them from wild animals and used heavy equipment to move the disabled vehicles off the road, mangling them. What the aid groups sayPalestine Red Crescent Society representatives said last week that ambulances had set out around 3:30 a.m. on March 23 to evacuate Palestinian civilians wounded by Israeli shelling. The Red Crescent said that an ambulance and its crew had been hit by Israeli forces and that several more ambulances and a fire truck headed to the scene over the next few hours to rescue them. A U.N. vehicle was also sent, the United Nations said. Seventeen people were dispatched in total, of whom 10 were Red Crescent workers, six were emergency responders from Gaza’s civil defense service and one was a U.N. worker. Mourners on March 31 during a funeral procession for the rescue workers. It took days to negotiate access to retrieve the 15 bodies. The Red Crescent said that one medic was still missing and that one,Munther Abed, had been detained by Israeli forces and later released. The Red Crescent said Israel’s “targeting” of its medics should be “considered a war crime” and demanded an investigation. It added that the latest killings brought to 27 the number of its members killed during the war, which started on Oct. 7, 2023, with a deadly Hamas-led attack. On Friday, the president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, told reporters that, based on autopsies and forensic evidence, the emergency workers had been “targeted from a very close range.”Reaction in Israel so farThe case has received broader coverage in Israel since the exposure of the video. Politicians have mostly remained silent, perhaps waiting for the military to complete its inquiry. Mr. Harel, the military affairs analyst, said the inquiry was a first test for the recently installed military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, regarding the military’s international standing. And the larger question of accountability remains. Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization, found last year that of 573 cases of suspected war crimes in Gaza examined over the past decade by the army, only one led to prosecution.

Amelia Nierenberg reported from London, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. Israel Turns Away 2 British LawmakersThe lawmakers, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, said they were “astounded” by the decision to refuse them entry. Britain and Israel traded sharp criticisms this weekend after Israel blocked two British lawmakers from entering the country and sent them back to London. The members of Parliament, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, both of whom belong to the governing center-left Labour Party, said in ajoint statementon Sunday that they had been “astounded” to be denied entry to Israel the previous day. They described their trip as “an M.P.s’ delegation” to the Israeli-occupied West Bank alongside charities “to visit humanitarian aid projects and communities.”“We are two, out of scores of M.P.s, who have spoken out in Parliament in recent months on the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of complying with international humanitarian law,” they said, adding that lawmakers “should feel free to speak truthfully in the House of Commons, without fear of being targeted.”Abtisam MohamedIsrael rejected the lawmakers’ characterization of their plans. The Israeli immigration authority said in a statement that it was “untrue” that they were members of a formal parliamentary delegation, adding that no Israeli official had “any knowledge of the arrival of the said delegation.”The statement said that Israeli immigration officials had questioned the lawmakers and two aides and determined that they intended to “spread hate speech against Israel” and “document the security forces.”David Lammy, the British foreign secretary, jumped to the lawmakers’ defensein a statementon Saturday, describing Israel’s treatment of “two British M.P.s on a parliamentary delegation” as “unacceptable, counterproductive and deeply concerning.”Mr. Lammy said that he had “made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians.”Yuan YangMs. Yang and Ms. Mohamed both entered Britain’s Parliament for the first time in July, in the election that brought their party into government. Ms. Mohamed is a lawyer. Ms. Yang is an economist and a former correspondent for The Financial Times. The rejection they experienced also prompted political controversy in Britain, where the crisis in Gaza has long beentense. The Labour government has in some respects beenless supportive of Israelthan its center-right Conservative predecessor: In September, Britain announced that it wouldsuspend some arms exportsto Israel. Mr. Lammy said at the time that there was a “clear risk” some of the weapons could be used in “a serious violation of international humanitarian law.”On Sunday, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, defended Israel and appeared to blame the lawmakers in atelevision interview: “What I think is shocking is that we have M.P.s in Labour who other countries will not allow through,” she said. Those commentswere quickly denounced in turn. “It’s disgraceful you are cheerleading another country for detaining and deporting two British MPs,” Mr. Lammywrote on X. “Do you say the same aboutTory MPs banned from China?”Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints: President Trump is more aligned than his predecessoron Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.

Recovering Pope Surprises Pilgrims With a Public Appearance,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/europe/pope-francis-surprise-public-appearance.html,2025-04-06T12:32:47Z,World,"Pope Francis was wheeled through a crowd that included health care workers from around the world, who had been told he was watching their Jubilee Mass on television.",Pilgrimages; Popes; Health Care Workers,Francis,,Roman Catholic Church,"Thunderous applause and cheers greeted Pope Francis on Sunday, as he made his first public appearance since leaving a Rome hospital two weeks ago. Reporting from Vatican CityRecovering Pope Surprises Pilgrims With a Public AppearancePope Francis was wheeled through a crowd that included health care workers from around the world, who had been told he was watching their Jubilee Mass on television. As entrances go, this one was both unexpected and welcome. That much was clear from the thunderous applause and cheers on Sunday as Pope Francis made his first public appearance since leaving a Rome hospital two weeks ago. Francis arrived, unannounced, on the dais in St. Peter’s Square near the end of a Mass that was part of a pilgrimage by health care workers and their patients. The pope said very few words, his voice still strained after a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and other problems that his doctors saidtwice brought him close to death. “Happy Sunday to everyone, many thanks,” Francis said, waving his hands. A nasal cannula was visible in both nostrils; Francis continues to rely on supplemental oxygen, the Vatican has said. Sitting on a wheelchair pushed by his trusted nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, Francis moved through groups of pilgrims — including dozens of doctors and nurses from around the world — who had come the Vatican on Sunday for this weekend’sJubilee of the Sick and Health Care Workers“What a wonderful surprise — the pope still has health problems but he wanted to give a gift to the faithful,” said Lamberto Rosa, a businessman who volunteers with the Order of Malta at some Vatican events. “He has a fighting spirit and wants to be present.”Francis has made physical closeness to his flock, dramatic gestures and a freewheeling style the hallmarks of his pontificate, and his appearance on Sunday suggested that he was determined to carry on with that approach despite his physical limitations. Since leaving the hospital in March, he has been living in his suite on the second floor of the Vatican guesthouse he calls home. The Vatican press office has repeatedly said that Francis has not been receiving visitors as he convalesces, though it reported on Friday that his speech was improving. Francis continues to rely on supplemental oxygen, the Vatican has said. “It must have cost him a lot to go through that,” said, Giuseppe Vanacore, the president of Italy’snational association for kidney transplant patients, who was present in the square on Sunday. Mr. Vanacore said he had been moved by the homily the pope had written for the Mass, which was read by Cardinal Rino Fisichella. Before beginning, Cardinal Fisichella had told those present that Francis, like many ill people, was watching the Mass on television. In the homily, Francis wrote that he had “much in common with you at this time of my life, dear brothers and sisters who are sick: the experience of illness, of weakness, of having to depend on others in so many things, and of needing their support.” That “is not always easy,” he wrote. In his traditional Sunday blessing, made public after the Mass, Francis wrote that he prayed “for doctors, nurses and health workers,” who often worked in difficult conditions. “Their mission is not easy and must be supported and respected,” he said, adding that he hoped “necessary resources will be invested in treatment and research, so that health systems are inclusive and attentive to the most fragile and the poorest.”After the Mass, the Vatican issued a statement saying that Francis had prayed and participated in the ritual of passing through the Holy Door in St. Peter’s Basilica, like other pilgrims. On Friday, in its twice weekly briefing on Francis’ health, the Vatican said the pope was “dedicating a lot of time to motor and respiratory therapy,” showing improvements in both. It added that the flows of supplemental oxygen he required were becoming less intense, and that blood tests showed that the infections in his lungs were also improving. People applauded and cheered as Francis moved through the crowd on Sunday. Some pumped their fists in encouragement, others waved flags. “Long live the pope,” they cheered. “It was a grand gesture — he showed his suffering,” said Massimiliano Porena, a nurse from San Camillo hospital in Rome. He described the appearance as “an act of love” toward health workers, “something we try to transmit to the patients we care for.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Russia Strikes Kyiv as Ukraine Mourns Deadly Attack on Zelensky’s Hometown,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/europe/ukraine-kyiv-attack-russia.html,2025-04-06T11:06:21Z,World,"While Russian missile and drone bombardments have been unrelenting over more than three years of war, they have intensified in recent weeks amid U.S.-led peace talks.",Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022),"Zelensky, Volodymyr; Trump, Donald J; Brink, Bridget",Black Sea; Kryvyi Rih (Ukraine); Kyiv (Ukraine),,"Smoke rising in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sunday after a Russian attack. One person was killed and seven wounded, officials said. Reporting from Kyiv, UkraineRussia Strikes Kyiv as Ukraine Mourns Deadly Attack on Zelensky’s HometownWhile Russian missile and drone bombardments have been unrelenting over more than three years of war, they have intensified in recent weeks amid U.S.-led peace talks. Russia bombarded Ukraine with ballistic missiles and drones on Sunday that killed one person and wounded at least seven others, the latest in a series of deadly attacks that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said makes clear Moscow has little real interest in cease-fire negotiations. While Russian drone and missile attacks have been unrelenting throughout more than three years of war, they have intensified in recent weeks amid ongoing peace talks led by the Trump administration. The Ukrainian authorities said the barrage on Sunday killed one man, damaged buildings and started fires in three neighborhoods of Kyiv, the capital. Damage and injuries were also reported elsewhere in Ukraine, as the country declared a day of mourning fora deadly strike on Fridayin the city of Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine. A missile strike on a residential neighborhood there killed 19 people, including nine children, and wounded 74 others. It damaged the courtyard of an apartment block, and emergency medical workers found some of the wounded in a playground, videos released by Ukraine’s emergency services showed. Russia’s ministry of defense said the missile hit a gathering of Ukrainian and foreign military personnel. But a U.N. team that visited the site said, citing witnesses, that a meeting of beauticians, not military personnel, had been underway at a nearby restaurant when the missile struck. Most of the children died while playing in a park, the United Nations said in a statement by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk. It was the deadliest single strike for children of the war, said Mr. Turk, who called the attack with a cluster munition warhead “an unimaginable horror.”A makeshift memorial at the site of Friday’s deadly strike in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Though he has expressed support for the Trump administration’s efforts to secure a cease-fire, Mr. Zelensky was critical of the tepid U.S. response to the attack on Kryvyi Rih, his hometown. He said he was “unpleasantly surprised” by asocial media postfrom the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A. Brink, that expressed horror over the strike but did not directly condemn Russia. And in his nightly address on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that he was “thankful to every country whose representatives have spoken out” about the strike and — although he did not single out the United States — emphasized that silence would embolden Moscow to “continue the war and keep ignoring diplomacy.”“We must all remember: The war continues,” Mr. Zelensky added. Ukrainian officials have accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of playing for time in cease-fire negotiations mediated by the Trump administration. After the attack on Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky said in aposton X, “The pressure on Russia is still insufficient, and the daily Russian strikes on Ukraine prove it.” He added, “These attacks are Putin’s response to all international diplomatic efforts.”While Ukraine agreed last month to accept an unconditional 30-day halt in the fighting, Russia did not. Both sides have agreed in principle to halt strikes against energy infrastructure temporarily,only to accuse each otherof violating the agreement. Kyiv and Moscow also considered acease-fire on the Black Sealast month in separate U.S.-mediated talks but are still negotiating whether or how it will come into force. Russia asked for an easing of sanctions in exchange. In the meantime, a Russian frigate and a Russian submarine in the Black Sea launched some of the cruise missiles fired on Sunday, a spokesman for Ukraine’s navy, Dmytro Pletenchuk, said. Among a small crowd standing outside the police perimeter at one missile strike site in Kyiv, the scene of smoldering, collapsed concrete fueled anger at Russia, as attacks have throughout the war, but also at what was seen as hapless American mediation. “The negotiations are taking place in one reality, and the war is going on in another reality in which we live,” said Maria Savchenko, whose family-owned business printing advertising posters was obliterated in the strike. “The president of the United States doesn’t really want to understand what is happening here,” she said. Russia, she said, intends to carry on fighting. Ukrainian officials say that, as the talks continue, Russia has shifted tactics in the missile and drone war by increasing the overall number of exploding drones and singling out certain cities for intense bombardments on some nights, rather than scattering attacks around the country. The Ukrainian Air Force said on March 30 that 4,133 drones and missiles were fired that month, an increase from earlier months. In Sunday’s attack, the air force said, Russia launched a mix of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones. In Kyiv, the aerial assault began with exploding drones. Missiles then followed, setting off air-raid alarms through the night and early morning. Valentyn Maidaniuk, a Kyiv resident, said he saw explosions flashing in the sky and heard buzzing from the drones’ engines as he walked to an air-raid shelter early Sunday. In the end, he said, “I didn’t manage to sleep at all.”The attack on Kyiv on Sunday damaged buildings and sparked several fires, the Ukrainian authorities said. Maria Varenikovacontributed reporting.

"Trump’s Tariffs Will Wound Free Trade, but the Blow May Not Be Fatal",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/europe/trade-trump-tariffs-brexit.html,2025-04-06T09:01:37Z,World,Free trade has been so beneficial to so many countries that the world may find a way to live without its biggest player.,International Trade and World Market; Customs (Tariff); International Relations; Great Britain Withdrawal from EU (Brexit),"Trump, Donald J; Starmer, Keir",,World Trade Organization; European Union,"President Trump on Wednesday in the White House Rose Garden, where he announced a sweeping list of tariffs on more than 100 countries. Reporting from LondonTrump’s Tariffs Will Wound Free Trade, but the Blow May Not Be FatalAnalysisFree trade has been so beneficial to so many countries that the world may find a way to live without its biggest player. President Trump’s self-proclaimed “liberation day,” in which he announcedacross-the-board tariffs on the United States’ trading partners, carries an echo of another moment when an advanced Western economy threw up walls around itself. LikeBrexit, Britain’s fateful vote nearly nine years ago to leave the European Union, Mr. Trump’s tariffs struck a hammer blow at the established order. Pulling the United States out of the global economy is not unlike Britain’s withdrawing from a Europe-wide trading bloc, and in the view of Brexiteers, a comparable act of liberation. The shock of Mr. Trump’s move isreverberating even more widely, given the larger size of the American economy and its place at the fulcrum of global commerce. Yet as with Brexit, its ultimate impact is unsettled: Mr. Trump could yet reverse himself, chastened by plummeting markets or mollified by one-off deals. More important, economists say, the rise of free trade may be irreversible, its benefits so powerful that the rest of the world finds a way to keep the system going, even without its central player. For all of the setbacks to trade liberalization, and the grievances expressed in Mr. Trump’s actions, the barriers have kept falling. The European Union, optimists point out, did not unravel after Britain’s departure. These days, the political talk in London is about ways in which Britain can draw closer to its European neighbors. Still, that sense of possibility has come only after years of turbulence. Economists expect similar chaos to buffet the global trading system as a result of Mr. Trump’s theatrical exit. “It will not be the end of free trade, but it is certainly a retreat from unfettered free trade, which is the way the world seemed to be going,” said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. “Logically, this would be a time when the rest of the world bands together to promote free trade among themselves,” he said. “The reality is, it’s going to be every country for itself.”Shipping containers at the Port of Felixstowe in England. The post-Brexit relationship between Britain and the European Union may serve as an example of what is to come for the United States and its trading partners. Such a world will be not only unruly, but also potentially more dangerous. While trade wars do not necessarily spiral into shooting wars, historians note that some conflicts, like the War of 1812 and the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, were rooted in trade disputes. An all-out trade war between the United States and China would inject sparks into an already combustible relationship. “If you think about the broader conflict between the U.S. and China,” Professor Prasad said, “the economic and financial relationship provided a degree of balance. That balance is now eroding.”Mr. Trump has stopped short of the kind ofgunboat diplomacyused by Britain against China in the Opium Wars. But his pugilistic posture toward some of America’s closest trading partners, like Canada and Mexico, has deepened the sense of dislocation and could divide the response of countries. Economists said the United States’ singular position as the biggest engine of global growth, because of its unquenchable appetite for cars manufactured in Germany and iPhones assembled in China, would make it hard for countries to reorient their trading relationships around a less welcoming American market. That suggests many countries will end up trying to cut deals with Mr. Trump, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would do last week, after the United Stateshit Britain with a 10 percent tariff. Others will impose retaliatory tariffs to try to better their bargaining position with the United States. China struck swiftly on Friday, withtit-for-tat tariffs of 34 percent, after speculation that it might coordinate its response with its neighbors Japan and South Korea. Already, the European Union is warning countries that find themselves priced out of the American market not to dump cheap exports in its market. “A lot will depend on how Europe decides to play this,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. “The Europeans could get closer to China and pick up a lot of the slack from Vietnam.”A factory in Hangzhou, China, where stainless steel rings used in bicycles are manufactured. “That would create a big non-U.S. trading bloc,” he continued. “But I don’t think the Europeans are going to be comfortable with all those Chinese exports pouring into Europe. Where do these excess exports go?”Europe’s likely resistance to absorbing more Chinese imports willconfront China’s leaders with a thorny challenge. They can either adopt measures to make China less reliant on exports by stoking demand among their own population, something they tried to do in the past with mixed results. Or they can seek a deal with Mr. Trump, something they failed to do during his first term, despite signing a preliminary agreement. For all of the criticism of Mr. Trump’s blunt-force methods, economists say he is responding to a genuine problem: the rise of China as a hypercompetitive trading power, one that heavily subsidizes its own companies. That has hollowed out American manufacturing, in Mr. Trump’s view; the tariffs, he claims, will bring it back. When he came into office, President Barack Obama asked whether one of his Democratic predecessors, Bill Clinton, had given away too much in allowing China to join the World Trade Organization. Mr. Obama imposed a 35 percent tariff on China from 2009 to 2012, for dumping tires into the American market. And when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. inherited Mr. Trump’s first-term tariffs on China, he left them in place. “The global trading system has been under pressure for a while, and that pressure has really been symbolized by the rise of China,” Professor Johnson said. “It was more damaging and disruptive than Japan.”In 2024, Professor Johnson, along with Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and James A. Robinson of the University of Chicago, received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for research into the colonial-era institutions that made some countries wealthier than others as they developed. One common factor, whether in Asia or Africa: “Almost all countries that escaped poverty did it through trade,” he said. For that reason, it is unlikely that the world will drift into a state of autarky, where countries try to produce all they need within their own borders. The nature of global supply chains — from semiconductor factories in Taiwan to auto-parts suppliers in Canada — makes such economic isolation all but impossible, in any event. The countries that will face the most pain from a trade war, economists said, are low-income exporters of commodity goods, which have little leverage to respond to Mr. Trump. Several are in Africa, among them Nigeria, which was hit with a 14 percent tariff, and Kenya and Ghana, both hit with 10 percent. A textile factory in Nairobi, Kenya. Many African countries, including Kenya, were hit with tariffs. The World Trade Organization estimated that Mr. Trump’s measures, on top of his previously announced tariffs, will reduce global merchandise trade volume 1 percent in 2025, a downward revision of nearly four percentage points from its earlier forecast. A full-scale trade war would do further damage. Still, some optimists predicted that Mr. Trump’s tariffs would accelerate the integration of other countries, either through bilateral trade deals or regional trade pacts. The United States, they note, is the only country that pulled out of theTrans-Pacific Partnership, which waslater renegotiatedwithout it, forging a trade pact among the other big economies that border the Pacific. Even Brexit, though it drew on the same grievances about globalization as Mr. Trump’s MAGA movement, was not framed as a protectionist project. Brexiteers argued that, once freed from the shackles of the European Union, Britain could negotiate better trade deals on its own. Last week, they credited Brexit as the reason Britain’s 10 percent tariff was half that of the European Union. “You’re going to see more countries around the world striking free trade deals, just around the U.S.,” said Jason Furman, a professor of economic policy at Harvard Kennedy School who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. “I see it as a turning point for the United States at the center of the global trading system,” he said, “but not for how the world thinks about free trade.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

Reporting from New YorkTrump, Tariffs, a New Leader: Canada’s Liberals Enjoy Early Election LiftThe Liberal Party, which not long ago seemed destined to crash in federal elections under Justin Trudeau, is experiencing a reversal of fortune. Here’s what a close review of polls shows. Though Canada’s election began in earnest only late last month, public opinion polls have captured a gripping political narrative that has been unfolding since the start of the year. Between President Trump’s trade war, his threats of annexation and the resignation of Canada’s last prime minister, a lot happened in the run-up to this race to shape how voters are feeling. The election will take place April 28, so there’s plenty of time for things to change, but The New York Times reviewed available public opinion polls, closely examining them for quality and consistency. Trump continues to wield significant influence. When Mr. Trump kicked off a trade war andbegan threatening the nation’s sovereigntyin early February, he reversed months of polling trends: Support climbed for the Liberals and shrank for the Conservatives. In only eight weeks, the Conservative Party’s 20-plus-point lead vanished, and now the Liberals are leading the pollsby an average of six percentage points. Canadians have consistently cited tensions with the United States as themost important issuefacing the country. And among voters who had switched their intended support this year from another party to the Liberal Party, 51 percent said Mr. Trump’s actions were one of their top two reasons for doing so,according to a recent poll from the Angus Reid InstituteA new leader brings momentum. Mark Carney speaking to a crowd last month in Ottawa after being announced as the successor to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as head of the Liberal Party of Canada. The Liberals are also benefiting from a fresh face. Prime Minister Mark Carney is leading the party after winning the race to replace former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced plans to resign in January and stepped down last month. That same Angus Reid poll found an even larger share — 56 percent — of party-switchers saying that Mr. Carney was one of the top two reasons they were shifting their support to the Liberals. Mr. Carney is the only national party leader whose favorability rating — the percentage of voters who like him minus those who say they don’t — is currently positive, and his popularity surpasses that of his party itself. Inan Angus Reid pollfrom late March, 54 percent of Canadians had a favorable view of Mr. Carney, compared with 35 percent for the Conservative Party’s leader, Pierre Poilievre, and 33 percent for Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the leftist New Democratic Party, or N.D.P. Mr. Carney was also preferred by a majority of Canadians (52 percent), when asked which leader, between him and Mr. Poilievre, they thought would make the best prime minister. “If Trudeau had stayed on, I don’t think he would be getting the same numbers,” said Éric Grenier, a Canadian polling analyst who runsThe Writ, an election analytics site. “And if Trump wasn’t there, I don’t think Carney would be getting the same numbers.”Conservatives aren’t doing that bad; Liberals are just doing that well. With a multiparty parliamentary system like Canada’s, any single party polling at or above 40 percent of the popular vote has a really strong chance of securing a majority government. Currently, the Liberals are polling, on average, around 44 percent, according tothe CBC’s poll tracker,while the Conservatives are sitting at 38 percent. In past cycles, the Conservatives have won powerwith a similar share of support, but in those elections, voters on the left were split. Mr. Poilievre during a news conference on the morning of his campaign launch in late March in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. The Liberal Party has managed to consolidate support on the left at the expense of other parties. While the Liberals recovered in the polls,support for the N.D.P. has sunkto some of the lowest levels in decades. “There have always been ‘A.B.C.’ voters — ‘anything but conservative’ — but the movement is marginal,” said Philippe Fournier, who runs the election analytics site 338Canada. “Not this time.”Conservatives are losing support even among core demographics. One notable demographic shift in the polls lately has been that Canada’s younger voters have been breaking for the Conservatives. Polling from Legerin late March found that Canadians aged 18 to 34 preferred the Conservatives over the Liberals 39 to 37 percent, whilesome pollshave showed young voters favoring the Conservatives by as much as 10 percentage points. Over the past two years, Mr. Poilievre had made gains in this cohort, particularly among young men, in part because he offered change from the status quo, which many young Canadians feel isn’t working for them. In fact, while Canadians over 50 have cited the continuing trade war as the top issue facing the country,those under 50 have been just as likelyto point to other issues, such as the cost of living, as their top concern. Similarly, just as in the United States, there’s a gender gap, with men much more likely than women to back the Conservatives. But these gaps are shrinking in almost every group, according toAngus ReidSupport among men is now nearly evenly split, in the latest poll, with 44 percent of men saying they plan to vote Conservative compared with 42 percent who say they plan to vote Liberal. Only one age-gender group — men aged 35 to 54 — in the latest poll had a plurality that clearly preferred the Conservative Party, but that gap has also narrowed. Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

Reporting from OttawaThe Canadian Political Brawler Who Had a 25-Point Lead and a Problem: TrumpJust two months ago, Pierre Poilievre seemed destined to become Canada’s next prime minister. But his double-digit polling lead vanished with President Trump’s threat to annex Canada. Carrying his 6-year-old daughter on his shoulders, Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative Party leader running to lead Canada, was wading through a crowd of well-wishers in his electoral district in Ottawa. “Hey, there he is, Mr. Alexander!” he said, gripping the hand of Mark Alexander, whose dairy farm the politician had visited 21 years ago on his first run for office. Mr. Poilievre recalled sitting at the farmer’s kitchen table. He recalled, too, that Mr. Alexander did not get his Conservative membership card because “the party messed up.”“Then I came and milked cows with you,” Mr. Poilievre went on, as the farmer’s wife, Lynn, chimed in, “Yes, you did!”After asking about four family members — by name — Mr. Poilievre moved on. “He really cares about the people,” said Ms. Alexander, who was planning to vote for Mr. Poilievre. “And he has an amazing memory. Like he’ll remember those very little details of the first time we met.”Mr. Poilievre, 45 — who is aiming to defeat Prime Minister Mark Carney, 60, and end a decade of Liberal rule in Canada’s general election on April 28 — is considered one of Canada’s most dexterous campaigners, communicators and politicians. On the rink at the Manotick Curling Center. “The thing about Canada is, every small town has two things: a steeple and a curling rink,” said Sandy Leach, a local member of the Manotick Curling Club. Elected as the youngest member of Canada’s Parliament in 2004 — by knocking off a Liberal incumbent, the defense minister, no less —he has excelled as a fierce political operative, a hyperpartisan attack dog, a masterful policy wonkand a creator ofviral social media that has earned him fans in President Trump’s inner circle. But with less than a month left before the vote, Mr. Poilievre will need all of his skills in a race that has been turned upside down by once-unimaginable events: threats to annex Canada from an American president who launched a trade war as a first salvo. Mr. Poilievre had seemed destined to become Canada’s next leader as his party sat on what looked like aninsurmountable lead in the pollsjust a couple of months ago when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, enfeebled by two years of pounding by Mr. Poilievre, was forced to step down. “Pierre Poilievre is, on the cut-and-thrust of politics, one of the most incisive and aggressive takedown artists,” said Ken Boessenkool, a Conservative who worked for former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative. “He has the ability to find an opponent’s weakness and, and just go at them in a way that is devastating.”“He understands the political game and has played that political game successfully, better than almost anyone else,” Mr. Boessenkool added. Mr. Poilievre speaking to a crowd alongside his wife, Anaida, in Manotick last month. But the Conservatives’ 25 percentage point lead in the polls has swiftly turned into a single-digit deficit as Mr. Trump has become the race’s dominant issue. Polls show voters believe Mr. Carney better suited to handling the American president. Mr. Poilievre’s campaign, however, has said relatively little about Mr. Trump and has continued focusing on attacking the Liberals. Many voters associate Mr. Poilievre with Mr. Trump, analysts say, a link that has become a liability. “He and his team are going to have to recognize the game is being played in a different arena right now, and how you play in that arena may require a demonstration of other political skills,” said Tim Powers, a Conservative who has worked on several campaigns. “Part of it is showing people a relatability that isn’t always about being the loudest, the toughest, the most aggressive in the room,” Mr. Powers added. “That you can listen, that fighting isn’t always throwing the first punch.”Mr. Poilievre’s angry style of politics channeled Canadian voters’ fatigue and frustration toward Mr. Trudeau, but now that he is gone and Canada is under threat, many voters are turning away from Mr. Poilievre,polls show“Honestly, I think he’s a bully,” said Mohammad Jubaer, 47, a resident of Mr. Poilievre’s electoral district. “He tries to scare people to vote. I don’t think this is the right approach. Maybe it’s an approach that works in the U.S., but not for Canadians.”Campaign signs for Mr. Poilievre and Bruce Fanjoy, a liberal candidate running against him. A spokesman for Mr. Poilievre’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. A career politician, Mr. Poilievre nevertheless describes himself as an outsider because of his origins. Born in Calgary to a 16-year-old single mother, he was adopted by two schoolteachers and raised in a middle-class home in the city’s suburbs. He is married to Anaida Poilievre, a Venezuelan immigrant who grew up in Montreal and worked in Parliament. The Poilievres have two young children. Mr. Poilievre became interested in politics as a teenager, joining the Reform Party, a right-wing populist party that embodied western Canada’s alienation from the country’s traditional centers of power, Ontario and Quebec. He studied at the University of Calgary, where a cluster of political scientists backing the movement became known as the “Calgary School.”Tom Flanagan, a member of the Calgary School who went on to serve under Mr. Harper, said Mr. Poilievre and other future political leaders were influenced by the university’s climate in the late 1990s. “Among the students, there was a ferment because of the Reform Party,” Mr. Flanagan said. The Reform Party merged with the Progressive Conservatives to form the current Conservative Party in 2003. Mr. Poilievre left Calgary before graduating to work for a lawmaker in Ottawa in 2002. After his surprising election at the age of 24, Mr. Poilievre rose quickly under Mr. Harper, who served as prime minister between 2006 and 2015. Stephen Harper, who was then the prime minister, with Mr. Poilievre, left, at a swearing-in ceremony in Ottawa in 2013. In Canada’s political culture, it is nearly impossible for an individual lawmaker to propose significant bills and establish a personal legislative record. So Mr. Poilievre succeeded in standing out by being a pugilist skilled at political theater and social media, said Alex Marland, a political scientist at Acadia University. Mr. Poilievre also displayed a deep understanding of the budget and other policy issues, drawing a sharp contrast with other populists like Mr. Trump and Boris Johnson, Mr. Marland said. “One difference,” Mr. Marland said, “is that Poilievre would probably stay up late at night reading everything.”Mr. Poilievre’s two decades in Ottawa overlapped with what Mr. Powers described as the party’s “professionalization” of politics: the widespread use of political consultants, the building of databases for fund-raising and voter-profiling and the use of direct communication with voters, including through social media. Mr. Poilievre is “the first professional politician that the Conservative Party of Canada has had,” Mr. Powers said. “He has spent years studying how to master his craft — he’s made mistakes along the way. But he’s truly a professional politician, for good or for bad.”In addition to his skill as a political pugilist, Mr. Poilievre also displayed a deep understanding of the budget and other policy issues, said Alex Marland, a political scientist at Acadia University. Since becoming Conservative leader in 2022, Mr. Poilievre has campaigned on a traditional Conservative message of lower taxes, smaller government and personal freedom, as well as easing regulations for the oil industry and getting tough on crime. But he has also turned more sharply to populism than previous Conservatives, Mr. Flanagan said. Mr. Poilievre has championed the truckers who occupied Ottawa for weeks to protest vaccine mandates during the pandemic. He has railed against “utopian wokeism.” Mr. Poilievre has attacked the mainstream news media, preferring to give interviews to right-wing media and podcasters. “He’s polarizing the electorate,” said Peter Woolstencroft, an emeritus professor at the University of Waterloo who was also involved in Conservative politics for decades. “He’s not looking to accumulate a big coalition victory.”Mr. Jubaer, the voter who lives in Mr. Poilievre’s district, said he had grown weary of Mr. Trudeau. But he was planning to vote for Mr. Poilievre’s main rival in the district, Bruce Fanjoy, a Liberal candidate who said he had knocked on 15,000 doors in his bid to dislodge Mr. Poilievre. The Liberal candidate in Mr. Poilievre’s district, Mr. Fanjoy, campaigning last month. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Fanjoy dropped by the house of Brian Vallipuram, 64, a restaurant owner who said he had voted for Mr. Poilievre in the previous election. But now that the election’s main issue was Mr. Trump, Mr. Vallipuram was leaning toward Mr. Carney, who served as the head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. “Carney knows business,” Mr. Vallipuram said. “But Poilievre is a career politician.”With Canada’s political landscape having shifted so drastically, Mr. Poilievre has three weeks to find his balance, a challenge even for someone with his political skills and decades at the heart of Canadian politics. “Everything he’s ever done will either have prepared him properly for this moment or not,” said Mr. Boessenkool, the Conservative who worked for Mr. Harper. “I wouldn’t bet against him, but I wouldn’t bet my house.”Mr. Poilievre and his wife at his campaign launch last month.

Sudanese Refugees Flee to Chad Amid Deadly Airstrikes,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/africa/sudan-strikes-refugees.html,2025-04-06T08:55:04Z,World,"As a civil war enters its third year, it only seems to be getting worse.","Refugees and Displaced Persons; War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity; Doctors",,Sudan; Darfur (Sudan); Chad,Rapid Support Forces (Sudan); Sudanese Armed Forces," Sudanese Refugees Flee to Chad Amid Deadly AirstrikesAs a civil war enters its third year, it only seems to be getting worse. The first stop for many Sudanese refugees fleeing deadly ground attacks and airstrikes in Sudan is a remote mobile medical clinic along the border with Chad, operated by Doctors Without Borders. Sudan’s civil war is entering its third year, and increasing airstrikes have been a driving factor for many refugees now fleeing the country for safety in neighboring Chad. “I’m always afraid of the planes,” said Kubrah Abdullah Dawood, 25, a Sudanese refugee who had just crossed the border alone with her 11-month-old daughter. Doctors Without Borders staff members quickly ushered her into a makeshift tented clinic just steps from the border, where she told them that she fled Darfur’s capital, El Fasher, after an airstrike killed her brother. She said it had been a drone attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the R.S.F. “As the Sudanese Armed Forces have made progress in Khartoum, we’ve seen more [R.S.F.] moving towards Darfur,” said Kate Hixon, advocacy director for Sub-Saharan Africa Amnesty USA. “Wherever the R.S.F. is, we’ve seen burning of villages, blocking of aid, conflict related sexual violence, and we expect an increase in that in the coming weeks.”While Ms. Hixon notes an expected increase in ground attacks as the R.S.F. regroups in its Darfur stronghold, she said airstrikes from both sides of the war had been a driving factor of recent displacement. In recent months, the influx of refugees to the region prompted Doctors Without Borders to scale up its services along the more rural northern border regions of Chad. Survivors who recently fled the Darfur region described to The New York Times how airstrikes by Sudan’s military would follow shortly after R.S.F. fighters infiltrated their villages or marketplaces. “The R.S.F. would raid the village, [and then] the [Sudanese military] would strike,” said Fayza Adam Yagub, 38, from Saraf Omra, at a refugee camp in Adré, Chad. “But the R.S.F. would manage to escape, and the poor people were the ones getting hit.”As recently as March 25, a Sudanese military airstrike in the small village of Toura in North Darfurkilled at least 54 peopleand wounded dozens more, according to local monitoring groups, which called the attack a war crime — an accusation the army has denied. The R.S.F. fighters, and their allied militias, have also been accused of targeting civilians. Sudan’s military and the R.S.F. have been embroiled in a brutal civil war that has killed nearly 20,000 civilians and displaced over 12 million people, according to the United Nations, which noted that the situation was only getting worse.

Vietnam Offers to Drop U.S. Tariffs to Zero. Will That Be Enough for Trump?,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/asia/vietnam-trump-tariff-delay.html,2025-04-06T08:31:04Z,World,"In recent years Vietnam has forged strategic and economic links with the United States, its former foe, making the steep tariff rate all the more of a shock.",United States International Relations; Customs (Tariff); International Trade and World Market,"Lam, To; Trump, Donald J",Vietnam,,"An earlier version of this article had an outdated reference to Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam. Mr. Lam is no longer the president of Vietnam; he is now general secretary of the country’s governing Communist Party. To Lam, Vietnam’s top leader, in Hanoi last month. He was one of the first world leaders to reach out to President Trump after details of the new tariffs were announced. Tung Ngo reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, and Sui-Lee Wee from Bangkok. Vietnam Offers to Drop U.S. Tariffs to Zero. Will That Be Enough for Trump? In recent years Vietnam has forged strategic and economic links with the United States, its former foe, making the steep tariff rate all the more of a shock. Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam, has asked President Trump to delay the imposition of tariffs for at least 45 days so the two sides can avert a move that would devastate the Vietnamese economy and raise prices for American consumers. The 46 percent tariff rate the United States has said it will impose on Vietnam is among the highest any country faces. The prospect of such a steep tariff has left Vietnam with a sense of whiplash and deep apprehension. It also presents a sharp contrast to Washington’s recent embrace of Hanoi as an important bulwark against China and a manufacturing destination for many American apparel brands. Mr. Lam’s proposal to President Trump was laid out in a letter dated Saturday, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times. In the letter, Mr. Lam called on Mr. Trump to appoint a U.S. representative to lead negotiations with Ho Duc Phoc, a Vietnamese deputy prime minister, “with the goal of reaching an agreement as soon as possible.”Mr. Lam had been one of the first world leaders to reach out to Mr. Trump after thetariffs were announced. In a phone call, he offered to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports to zero, and urged Mr. Trump to do the same, according to the Vietnamese government. Vietnam has said its tariffs on U.S. goods is an average of 9.4 percent. Mr. Trump later described the call as “very productive.”In his letter, Mr. Lam asked Mr. Trump to meet him in person in Washington at the end of May “to jointly come to an agreement on this important matter, for the benefit of both our peoples and to contribute to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.”Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Vietnam, which faces punishingly high tariffs along with China, Cambodia and Laos, would be the hardest-hit economy in Asia if the tariffs are imposed as planned on Wednesday, according to economists. The United States is Vietnam’s largest export market, accounting for about 30 percent of the country’s total exports. A 46 percent tariff rate would put 5.5 percent of Vietnam’s gross domestic product at risk,according to ING, a Dutch financial services company. It would also hurt American consumers, because Vietnam is crucial in the global manufacturing supply chain. For decades, the country has built its economy around attracting foreign investment with cheap labor and a young work force. It is now a top manufacturer of brands such as Adidas and Lululemon. Nike makes about 50 percent of its footwear in Vietnam. After Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on China during his first term, Vietnam benefited from companies shifting their manufacturing there. The speed with which Vietnam made its offer of zero percent tariffs reflected the government’s concern that some international manufacturers in the country might be tempted to relocate to China, said Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, a think tank based in London. “China has more firepower, more scale,” Mr. Bland said. “So the fear is you basically see things like electronics manufacturing going to China in the medium term.”A garment factory in Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday. Within Hanoi, the recent moves by the Trump administration have cast doubts on the reliability of the United States, which in recent years has assiduously courted Vietnam. In 2023, the two former enemies cemented a new strategic relationship, a move seen as a milestone in U.S. foreign policy five decades after the Vietnam War. The Biden administration viewed Vietnam — one of the few Southeast Asian nations that has publicly pushed back against China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea — as critical to the U.S. effort to counter China’s mounting ambitions in the region. “Vietnam’s position in the Pacific, its view on China, its willingness to work with America, was its strongest card,” said Huong Le Thu, the deputy program director for Asia for the International Crisis Group. “Trump doesn’t see it that way. He doesn’t see allies or strategic values. He just sees numbers and tariffs.”While explaining the tariffs, Mr. Trump said that Vietnam charges the United States “90 percent,” a figureapparentlybased on Vietnam’s current trade surplus with the U.S., worth $123.5 billion. (Vietnam disputed that calculation.)The tariffs come at a precarious time for Mr. Lam, who needs to secure a strong economic performance as he heads into next year’s party congress, where the country’s top leaders will be selected. Specifically, the government aims to achieve 8 percent growth in gross domestic product as part of its drive to secure middle-income status, a World Bank designation, said Karl John of Asia Trade Experts, a business consultancy. Even before Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement, Vietnam was working to win favor with the new administration. It signed provisional deals to import U.S. liquefied natural gas, cut some tariffs on American imports, and allowed SpaceX to open a company to launch its Starlink satellite internet service in Vietnam. The Trump organization is developing a $1.5 billion golf course and hotel project in Mr. Lam’s home province. Alexandra StevensonandMatthew Mpoke Biggcontributed reporting.

It was Overthrow Musk, not Everyone Hates Elon. A fake advertisement on a bus stop in London last month. Reporting from London‘0 to 1939 in 3 seconds’: Why Anti-Elon Musk Satire Is Flourishing in BritainHumor and art have been used to mock the powerful in Britain for centuries. Now Elon Musk is on the receiving end. The mischievous posters began appearing all over London in the past two months. On the side of an East London bus stop, one of them shows Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, emerging from a Tesla’s roof with his hand pointing upward in astraight-armed salute. “Goes from 0 to 1939 in 3 seconds,” the ad reads. “Tesla. The Swasticar.”Another mock ad shows Mr. Musk and President Trump in front of a red Tesla with the words: “Now With White Power Steering.” In North London, a fake movie billboard blares: “The Fast and the Führer,” with a picture of Mr. Musk saluting beside a Tesla with a DOGE license plate, a reference to the budget-slashing federal agency he currently leads on behalf of Mr. Trump. “Parental Guidance,” warns the billboard, put up by a group calling itself Overthrow Musk. “Tesla’s CEO is a far-right activist. Don’t give him your money.”Across the British capital and in several European cities, Mr. Musk’s signature business has become the target of the same kind of political anger that has fueledvandalismof Tesla cars in the United States and sometimes violent protests at his dealerships. There have been someinstancesof unruly protests and vandalism in Europe. But much of the anti-Musk sentiment has taken the form of political satire, of the kind that has flourished in Britain since at leastthe 18th century. Just outside Berlin, a group called the Center for Political Beauty used high-power lights to project the word “Heil” onto the side of a Tesla factory so that it read “Heil Tesla,” along with a picture of Mr. Musksaluting during a speech in Washington. In Italy, street art depicts Elon Musk taking off a mask to show Adolf Hitler’s face underneath. The words “Elon Mask” appear above the picture. “There’s never been a target exactly like this,” said John Gorenfeld, a software engineer who helped start a London-based group called “Takedown Tesla.” The group has organized protests of several dozen people for the past several weeks. They hold posters along freeways that say “Honk if you hate Elon.” And they have printed bumper stickers for Tesla owners with phrases like “Don’t make the same mistake” and “Pre-2020 Model.”“Nobody who is that rich and powerful has behaved that outrageously,” Mr. Gorenfeld said. “There’s something campy and ridiculous about Musk’s brand of toxicity. And it opens up a real space to ridicule.”Protesters outside a Tesla dealership in Berlin last month. Much of the anger at Mr. Musk in Germany stems from the billionaire’s strong support for the country’s far-right party, said Philipp Ruch, an activist. In Europe, Mr. Musk is not just a faraway example of American wealth and power. Over the last year, he has become a frequent political meddler, often weighing in on behalfof far-right causeson X, his social media platform, where he has 218 million followers. In Britain, Mr. Musk is known for sharing misinformation about a child rape scandal andcalling forPrime Minister Keir Starmer to be jailed. He has called for the release of Tommy Robinson, a far-right,anti-immigrant agitatorwho is in prison forcontempt of court. And he criticized the seven-year sentence of aneo-Nazi who incitedand took part in anti-immigrant riots last summer. The small anti-Musk groups that have popped up around Europe have the same basic goal: Tank Tesla’s stock price and sales as a way of sending a message to Mr. Musk and other super-wealthy people who are thinking of promoting far-right politics around the world. Some groups declined to be interviewed about their actions, citing concern about becoming a target of Mr. Musk’s ire on social media. But others were more open about their aims. “The point of this is to show Musk and other billionaires that they are vulnerable and can’t act with impunity,” said Ben Stewart, a founder of a British satirical activist group called Led by Donkeys, which worked with the Center for Political Beauty to project Mr. Musk’s image on the Berlin factory. “We have to harness global public opinion to push back.”Organizers think it’s working. Tesla’s stock price has almost halved since its high in December, around the same time that Mr. Musk began his high-profile role overseeing the firing of government workers and slashing federal agency budgets. This week, Tesla reported a 13 percentdrop in salescompared with a year ago. “What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don’t know, stop doing this,” Mr. Musksaid last week in Wisconsinwhere he was campaigning for a state supreme court candidate. And yet, he added with a shrug, “Long term, I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity.”The protesters who spoke about their aims said they wanted to challenge Mr. Musk’s influence without resorting to the vandalism thatthe billionaire has called outin the United States as “coordinated violence against a peaceful company.”Theodora Sutcliffe, a London resident who helped organize Tesla Takedown, said none of the people she works with are participating in violence. Instead, they have sought to find other ways to capture public attention. A worker walking past graffiti in East London that depicts Mr. Musk in a World War II-era Nazi uniform. Over the last year, Mr. Musk has frequently promoted far-right causes in Europe on X, where he has 218 million followers. At one of their protests, a wavy, 20-foot balloon man who vaguely resembled Mr. Musk saluted into the air. At other times, Ms. Sutcliffe and her fellow protesters have left fliers on the windshields of Tesla cars. “Once upon a time, Teslas were cool,” one flier says. “Now, sadly, that’s not the case. Driving a Tesla and using Tesla chargers means you’re propping up Elon Musk, a man who promotes climate deniers and fossil-fuel junkies.”“If you want to go viral in the U.K., you have to be smart, I think,” Ms. Sutcliffe said. “That’s our sense of humor normally.”The anti-Musk efforts in Berlin were led by Philipp Ruch, the artistic director for the Center for Political Beauty, a German activist group. In an interview, he said that much of the anger at Mr. Musk in Germany stems from the billionaire’ssupport for the country’s far-right party, the Alternative for Germany. “The first day that the administration comes in, he does the Hitler salute,” Mr. Ruch said. “This is something we couldn’t tolerate, politically and artistically.”Mr. Ruch performs many of his protests by “overwriting” one image with another. At the Tesla dealership, he used lights to superimpose his words and images of Mr. Musk to create a new artistic creation. (He said the police are now investigating his efforts, which were visible for about an hour.) Pictures of the building were spread widely on social media. Other efforts have gone viral, too. There are mock car air fresheners called “Musk-B-Gone” that promise to cover “the stench of fascism.” And cardboard cutouts of Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump, thanking Tesla owners for their support when they top up their cars at the company’s supercharger lots. “There are some people who are coming at Musk as though he’s some sort of passive agent of Trump and that really, this is just another way of getting to Trump,” said Ms. Sutcliffe. “There’s other people who perceive Musk as somebody who’s a unique type of threat that we really haven’t seen before in terms of his economic control and control of the information space.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Inspectors Say More Than 100 Chemical Weapons Sites Could Remain in Syria,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-assad.html,2025-04-06T04:01:08Z,World,"The number, far higher than any previous estimate, poses a test for the new government.

As president, Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons during the country’s long civil war. Megha Rajagopalan reported from Damascus, Syria. She interviewed former chemical weapons scientists and nonproliferation experts. Inspectors Say More Than 100 Chemical Weapons Sites Could Remain in SyriaThe number, far higher than any previous estimate, poses a test for the new government. Experts fear that sarin, chlorine and mustard gas stockpiles could be unsecured. More than 100 chemical weapons sites are suspected to remain in Syria, left behind after thefall of the longtime president, Bashar al-Assad, according to the leading international organization that tracks these weapons. That number is the first estimate of its kind as the group, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, seeks to enter Syria to assess what remains of Mr. al-Assad’s notorious military program. The figure is far higher than any that Mr. al-Assad has ever acknowledged. The sites are suspected to have been involved in the research, manufacturing and storage of chemical weapons. Mr. al-Assadusedweapons like sarin and chlorine gas against rebel fighters and Syrian civilians during more than a decade ofcivil war. The number of sites, and whether they are secured, has been a mystery since rebels toppled Mr. al-Assad last year. Now, the chemicals represent a major test for thecaretaker government, which is led by the groupHayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, but it has renounced its links to Al Qaeda. The stakes are high because ofhow deadly the weapons are, particularly when used in densely populated areas. Sarin, a nerve agent, can kill within minutes. Chlorine and mustard gas, weapons made infamous in World War I, burn the eyes and skin and fill the lungs with fluid, seemingly drowning people on land. Douma, Syria, at the site of a suspected chemical attack in 2018. The stakes for eliminating chemical weapons are high because of how deadly they can be. Experts are concerned about the potential for militant groups to gain access to poorly secured chemical weapons facilities. In a surprise visit in March to the global chemical weapons watchdog headquarters at The Hague, Syria’s foreign minister said that the government would “destroy any remains of the chemical weapons program developed under the Assad regime” and comply with international law. Experts are cautiously optimistic about the government’s sincerity. The current government allowed a team from the watchdog to enter the country this year to begin work documenting the sites, according to people with knowledge of the trip. But Syria remains in a precarious spot, asviolence erupted in the coastal regionin recent weeks between government forces and groups aligned with Mr. al-Assad. And despite promises, the new government has not yet appointed an ambassador to the watchdog — a key first step that is seen as a sign of a country’s commitment. Syria’s defense ministry declined to answer written questions about the weapons, saying without elaboration that the questions were not under its purview. In the early years of the civil war, Mr. al-Assad’s government declared the locations of 27 sites to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or O.P.C.W., which sent inspectors to visit and shut them down. But Mr. al-Assad continued to use chemical weapons until at least 2018, andresearch showedthat his government kept importing essential precursor chemicals. The current estimate of more than 100 sites comes from the watchdog and has been circulated recently among experts and international nonproliferation analysts. The organization said it had arrived at the number based on outside researchers, nonprofit groups and intelligence shared by its member countries. Some sites are probably hidden in caves or other places that are tough to find using satellite images, according to researchers, former organization staff members and other experts. That increases the likelihood that some weapons are not secured. “There are many locations that we don’t know about because the old regime was lying to the O.P.C.W.,” said Raed al-Saleh, the leader of the Syria Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, a volunteer group that says it is working with the government to try to dismantle chemical weapons sites. Receiving treatment for a suspected chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta area of Syria in 2018. Syria agreed to get rid of chemical weapons more than a decade ago. Nidal Shikhani, who leads the Chemical Violations Documentation Center of Syria and has worked with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for years, said his group had identified dozens of new locations that could be chemical weapons stockpiles or former research sites based on interviews with Syrian government scientists living in Europe. Finding and taking control of these sites is important for reasons beyond security. Inspectors also want to collect evidence for their investigations into Mr. al-Assad’s repeated use of chemical weapons. International observers, independent researchers and Syrian humanitarian groupshave documenteddozens of attacks, with thousands of people, including children among the victims. The most notorious was a2013 sarin gas assaulton the area of Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, the capital. Last year, Israel launched airstrikes on several Syrian regime facilities where chemical weapons were known to have been held. But it is unclear whether those strikes destroyed chemical weapons. Mr. Shikhani and others said they worried that the strikes merely created environmental contamination and destroyed evidence. International groups hope that chemical evidence will answer key questions about the Assad government’s research and help with international prosecutions. “The Israeli attacks that happened right after the fall of Assad are probably likely to not have put a dent in some of this, and potentially also obscured efforts toward accountability,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Sarin gas is prohibited under international law. The rules are murkier for other chemicals. Chlorine gas, for instance, can be created using common household cleaning products. That makes it nearly impossible to regulate the sale of precursors. Syria’s chemical weapons program began in the 1970s with the help of hundreds of government scientists, many of whom were trained in Germany and other parts of Europe, according to a Syrian former senior government chemist who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. The scientist worked in the chemical weapons division of the military’s Scientific Studies and Research Center. That center, which is under international sanctions, worked on conventional, chemical and nuclear arms. Inspecting the site of a possible chemical weapons attack in 2013 in Zamalka, Syria. Since Mr. al-Assad’s fall, inspectors have been trying to collect evidence for their investigations into his use of chemical weapons. Many scientists, he and others said, fled the country during the war, but others remain in Syria. The United States has imposed sanctions on more than 300 people and entities in connection with Syria’s chemical weapons program. Despite the assurances of the new government, weapons inspectors are tempering their optimism. They have heard such assurances in Syria before. Syria first agreed to get rid of chemical weapons more than a decade ago. But as inspectors conducted their work, they became convinced that Mr. al-Assad had no intention of revealing complete information about his stockpiles. Former staff members say they were perpetually hamstrung by the government. Inone episodein 2014, inspectors and Syrian staff members were investigating a potential site when a car in their convoy struck a roadside bomb.

"For Many Russian Exiles, Even a Peace Deal Might Not Mean a Ticket Home",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/europe/russian-exiles-return-putin-war-ceasefire.html,2025-04-06T04:01:07Z,World,"Hundreds of thousands fled Russia after the Ukraine invasion, fearing the draft and widening repression.

Reporting from IstanbulFor Many Russian Exiles, Even a Peace Deal Might Not Mean a Ticket HomeHundreds of thousands fled Russia after the Ukraine invasion, fearing the draft and widening repression. Talks toward a possible truce have done little to allay their fears. President Trump has saidhe trustsPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to abide by any peace deal on Ukraine they negotiate. Many Russians who fled the country in the early months of the war are not so sure. Nor do they have much faith that the conditions that drove them abroad — including a crackdown on any political dissent — will change anytime soon, whether Mr. Trump manages to broker a cease-fire or not. For the moment, those talks appear to have stalled since Mr. Putinrebuffed a proposal by Mr. Trump and Ukraine for a 30-daytruce. “The war will be over when Putin is over,” said Pavel Snop, a real-estate agent from St. Petersburg who fled to Turkey three years ago. He added, “Putin is going to keep bargaining: But he’s bargaining not for his country and its citizens, but for sanctions relief for himself and his friends.”For the Kremlin, the future ofsome 800,000 Russianswho fled their country after the invasion is a sensitive political and economic subject. Their existence is a stark reminder that many Russians opposed the war, or at least did not want to fight in it. Theexodusof so many people, who tend to be highly educated and work in professional fields that are in high demand, has also been damaging for the economy, experts say. “The war will be over when Putin is over,” said Pavel Snop, a real-estate agent from St. Petersburg, Russia, who fled to Turkey three years ago. But even if they are homesick and struggling to put down roots elsewhere, many Russians abroad do not believe that the Kremlin will stop persecuting people for their anti-government stance no matter what happens on the battlefield in Ukraine. A survey conducted by the research project OutRush thatsurveyed some 8,500 Russian émigrésin more than 100 countries from July to November, before cease-fire talks began, showed that only a small share planned to move back to Russia if the war ended. While the survey is not representative of all Russian émigrés, it showed that about 40 percent of poll respondents said they would consider returning if they saw democratic changes in Russia. “Right now, trust in the Russian government is extremely low,” said Emil Kamalov, who is part of the OutRush team, based in Italy and in the United States, that has studied the Russian exodus. On a recent Friday in Istanbul, émigrés from Russia, predominantly in their 30s and 40s, mingled with glasses of sparkling wine and kombucha at the opening of an exhibition at Black Mustache, a bookstore opened by a Russian exile in 2022. They shared stories of the bureaucratic complications of getting a residence permit in Turkey, of the difficulty of finding an apartment in Berlin and of hunts for workin their new countries. But many have friends or family still in Ukraine, and say their own ordeals pale in comparison to what they have gone through: loss of life, large-scale destruction and Russian occupation. Mikhail, 37, who said he works in entertainment, described the wrenching experience of uprooting his wife and young daughter from Moscow in March 2022, soon after the full-scale Russian invasion started. He asked that his surname not be used, fearing retribution against his wife who, unlike him, occasionally visits Russia. Now settled in Istanbul, Mikhail says he would like to at least visit Moscow without fear of being grabbed off the street and drafted to fight in Ukraine. After a first wave right after the invasion of Ukraine, the exodus of Russians, particularly of young men of fighting age, intensified in the fall of 2022 when Mr. Putin announceda partial mobilizationDrawings by a Russian émigré artist on display at Black Mustache. At the exhibition, other émigrés from Russia, predominantly in their 30s and 40s, mingled with glasses of sparkling wine and kombucha. Some went back after the Kremlin stopped issuing call-up orders for civilians, but the mobilization decree is still technically in place. That means the government can force any Russian civilians of military age into service. “Moving back is not even on the agenda for us right now,” Mikhail said. “Russia would need to at least officially end the mobilization so that I and others feel we are no longer in danger.”He said he saw “no concrete steps” by the Kremlin that would make him change his mind about the direction in which Mr. Putin was taking his country. Russian officials have made no public indication that they plan to ease things on the home front. Vyacheslav V. Volodin, speaker in the Russian Parliament, recently doubled down on threats against Russian émigrés,saying that those who leftshould “come and repent on Red Square.”Other lawmakers have been drafting laws to go after Russians involved with “hostile”foreign organizations— or who have merely spoken out against the war. Within two weeks of attending antiwar protests in St. Petersburg in 2022, and after being arrested and fined, Mr. Snop, the real-estate agent, booked a one-way ticket to Istanbul and said goodbye to his parents. That decision proved to be prescient: Six months into the war, and after he had left, Mr. Snop was issued a summons by the military. When his father died in 2023, he could not go to the funeral, fearing arrest over the draft-dodging and his antiwar activism. After three years of burning through his savings and grappling with the ups and downs of exile, Mr. Snop set up a business in Istanbul last summer with a local partner advising on real-estate deals for fellow Russians. The idea of going back to his old job in his beloved city of St. Petersburg is tempting, he said, but he does not want to return to a country he sees as increasingly authoritarian. He added that some Russians now take precautions when returning home, including purging their social media accounts, to avoid trouble with the authorities. His dream is “to be able to come to my favorite city freely, without deleting Telegram, speaking loudly and freely on the bus and at cafes.”Konstantin Sonin, an economics professor at Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that the departure of so many younger people could cause profound damage to Russia’s long-term economic development. “The brain drain is a major blow to the economy, and the young, most talented and promising ones were the first to get offers and leave,” he said. OutRush pollshowed that 80 percent of Russianémigréshave a university degree, compared with the average in Russia of 54 percent. Some sectors of the economy were hit particularly hard, like information technology and higher education, Professor Sonin said. In some host countries, the influx of well-educated Russians with high purchasing power has helped spur an economic boom: In Armenia, the economy in 2022 grew by 14 percent, with economists partly crediting the Russian émigrés. Oleg Chernousov, who set up Black Mustache, arrived in Istanbul in March 2022 with no Turkish and few savings. He said he was unlikely to return to Russia anytime soon. Clearly disturbed by the flight of thousands of young I.T. professionals, some Russian officials in the initial months of the full-scale invasiontried luring them backwith preferential mortgage rates and deferrals from military service. But the Kremlin has since largely given up such efforts. Oleg Chernousov is among those who said he was unlikely to return anytime soon. He arrived in Istanbul in March 2022 with no Turkish and few savings, before setting up the Black Mustache store, where he hosted the recent exhibition by an artist friend from St. Petersburg alongside a large selection of English-language books. Mr. Chernousov said that, whatever the outcome of cease-fire talks, the main concern of the émigrés he knows was the erosion of freedoms in Russia. And he does not think closer relations between Washington and Moscow will reverse that. “I don’t think Trump cares about what is happening inside Russia — democratic change in Russia definitely does not depend on that,” he said.

Israel Says Its Account of Rescue Workers Killed in Gaza Was Partly ‘Mistaken’,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-killing-rescue-workers-gaza.html,2025-04-05T22:57:17Z,World,The Israeli military had previously asserted that the workers had been “advancing suspiciously” toward its troops. A video obtained by The New York Times on Friday appeared to contradict that account.,"Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); Defense and Military Forces; Civilian Casualties; Humanitarian Aid; Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming",,Rafah (Gaza Strip); Israel; Gaza Strip,Hamas; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; International Committee of the Red Cross; United Nations," Reporting from JerusalemIsrael Says Its Account of Rescue Workers Killed in Gaza Was Partly ‘Mistaken’The Israeli military had previously asserted that the workers had been “advancing suspiciously” toward its troops. A video obtained by The New York Times on Friday appeared to contradict that account. The Israeli military on Saturday acknowledged that the initial accounts from troops involved in the killing last month of 15 people in southern Gaza — who the United Nations said were paramedics and rescue workers — had been partially “mistaken.”The assessment, which was shared in a briefing with reporters by an Israeli military official, came the day aftera videoobtained by The New York Times appeared to contradict the military’s earlier version of events. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity under army rules. The Israeli military official said the internal investigation of the attack, which has drawn international scrutiny and condemnation, is ongoing. Briefing reporters on Saturday night on the military’s initial findings, the official said forces from a reserve infantry brigade had been lying in ambush along a road to the north of the Gazan city of Rafah in the pre-dawn hours of March 23 and, at 4 a.m., had killed what he described as two Hamas security personnel and detained a third one. Two hours later, as dawn was breaking, a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck approached the same spot. The Israeli forces were still on the ground and received a report from a surveillance aircraft that the convoy was moving toward them, the official said. When the rescue workers arrived and left their vehicles, he said, the forces believed that more Hamas operatives had arrived and opened fire on the occupants of the vehicles from afar. The Israeli military had previously asserted, repeatedly and erroneously, that the vehicles were “advancing suspiciously” toward the troops “without headlights or emergency signals.”The video obtained by The Times shows that the approaching ambulances and fire truck were clearly marked and had their emergency signal lights on when Israeli troops hit them with a barrage of gunfire. The military official briefing reporters on Saturday did not offer an explanation for the contradiction, other than to say that the initial account from forces on the ground had been “mistaken.”The military official said that Israel believes at least six of the 15 were Hamas operatives, but did not immediately provide any evidence, citing the classified nature of the intelligence work involved in the identification process. In recent days, the military had repeatedly asserted that nine of those killed had been militants belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The Red Crescent, the International Committee of theRed Crossand the United Nations have previously said all of those killed were humanitarian workers who should never have come under attack. On March 30, rescue teams found 15 bodies, most in a shallow mass grave along with their crushed ambulancesand a vehicle marked with the U.N. logo. The video obtained by the Times was discovered on the cellphone of a paramedic who was found in that mass grave. The Israeli official declined to comment on whether any of those killed had been armed. He said Hamas operatives in Gaza often did not wear military uniforms and that Israel had seen them posing as civilians, hiding in hospitals and school buildings. Thekillingshave drawn international scrutiny since the 15 people first went missing. The United Nations and the Palestine Red Crescent Society said the aid workers had not been carrying weapons and posed no threat. The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, said that the bodies had been “targeted from a very close range.”Members of the Palestine Red Crescent and other emergency services carrying the bodies of fellow rescuers killed a week earlier by Israeli forces, during a funeral procession on March 31. Palestine Red Crescent Society officials said last week that ambulances had set out around 3:30 a.m. on March 23 to evacuate Palestinian civilians wounded by Israeli shelling but that an ambulance and its crew had been hit on the way. Several more ambulances and a fire truck headed to the scene over the next few hours to rescue them, according to the society, as did a U.N. vehicle, the United Nations said. Seventeen people were dispatched in total, of whom 10 were Red Crescent workers, six were emergency responders from Gaza’s civil defense and one was a U.N. worker. The Red Crescent said one medic was still missing and that one had been detained by Israeli forces and then later released. Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints: President Trump is more aligned than his predecessoron Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.

After Trump’s Tariffs, Stocks Plunged but Penguin Memes Ticked UpThe internet poked fun at the Trump administration’s decision to impose new tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Australian territories near Antarctica where many penguins but no people live. The Trump administration this week levied sweeping tariffs across the globe, provoking retaliation from other countries and sending the stock market tumbling. An unexpected consequence? Penguin memes. Images of the flightless birds have waddled their way across the internet this week after President Trumpimposed tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Australian territories near Antarctica that are home to many penguins but no people. Onememefeatured an altered photo ofthe explosive February White House meetingin which Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly clashed with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Instead of a fiery confrontation with the wartime leader, however, Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance sit next to a black-and-white bird. One person who posted the meme wrote, “Maybe it didn’t say thank you?” in a possible reference to Mr. Vance’s accusation that Mr. Zelensky had not appropriately thanked the United States for the military support Washington had provided Kyiv throughout the war. A different meme showed a penguinteaching sea gulls to aim their waste at Teslas, an apparent nod to Mr. Trump’s billionaire adviser, Elon Musk. Yetanothershowed a huge gathering of penguins with a caption citing “Unprecedented protests” on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, “as the population rises up” against Mr. Trump’s imposition of across-the-board tariffs. TheUNESCOWorld Heritage Convention notes the islands’ “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Still, Mr. Trump included the desolate islands on his list, imposing the 10 percent base-line tariff he placed on nearly all goods imported into the United States. The Wednesday announcement, which Mr. Trump described as America’s “Liberation Day,” sent shock waves across the world as both allies and adversaries scrambled to make sense of the new and hefty tariffs. The move has shot U.S. import duties to the highest levels in over a century. Also slotted for new tariffs were the British Indian Ocean Territory, a collection of mostly uninhabited islands, save for U.S. and British soldiers stationed on joint military bases. Other islands subjected to tariffs included Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand that has fewer than 2,000 inhabitants; the Norwegian islands of Svalbard, which has about 3,000 residents; and Jan Mayen, where the only humans are the military personnel who operate a weather and coastal services station. Mr. Trump has said little about the methodology behind the new system of calculations, but each country’s new tariff rate appeared to come from aformulathat takes the trade deficit America runs with a nation and divides it by the exports that country sent into the United States. The White House explained its methodologyin this post, which essentially confirms that formula. Then, because Mr. Trump said he was being “kind,” the final tariff number was cut in half. It is not clear how the administration decided to add Heard Island and McDonald Islands to the list of tariffs. The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Reporting from LondonU.K. Labour Lawmaker Suspended From Party After ArrestDan Norris, a lawmaker who won a seat in Parliament last year, was swiftly suspended from Britain’s governing party. Britain’s governing Labour Party on Saturday said it had suspended Dan Norris, one of its lawmakers in Parliament, after he was arrested by the police. Mr. Norris “was immediately suspended by the Labour Party upon being informed of his arrest,” the party said in a statement, adding that it “cannot comment further while the police investigation is ongoing.”The party did not specify why Mr. Norris, 65, had been arrested, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. In Britain, the police typically do not disclose the name of suspects unless they are charged. The BBC said that Mr. Norris wasarrestedon suspicion of rape, child sex offenses, child abduction and misconduct in a public office. In a statement that did not give any names, the Avon and Somerset Police said that a man in his 60s was arrested on Friday on suspicion of sexual offenses against a girl, rape, child abduction and misconduct in a public office. The police said he had been released on conditional bail. “In December 2024, we received a referral from another police force relating to alleged non-recent child sex offenses having been committed against a girl,” the police statement said. “Most of the offenses are alleged to have occurred in the 2000s, but we’re also investigating an alleged offense of rape from the 2020s,” it added. The police said that the investigation was “ongoing and at an early stage.”The Labour Party’s move is expected to mean that Mr. Norris will, pending the investigation, be effectively suspended from representing the party in the House of Commons. Last year Mr. Norris won a seat in Parliament representing North East Somerset and Hanham, near the city of Bristol, defeating a former Conservative cabinet minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mr. Norris is also the mayor of the West of England, responsible for the administration of several cities in a western region, a position he has held since 2021, though he is not running for re-election when that post is contested on May 1. His political career goes back more than two decades. Mr. Norris was a lawmaker from 1997 to 2010, representing the seat of Wansdyke, in the west of England. He was an assistant whip in the government of Tony Blair from 2001 to 2003, and a junior minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2009 to 2010, under Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

Netanyahu Will Meet Trump in Washington in a Sign of Their Strong TiesPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s expected visit, his second since January, underscores how the Israeli leader has seen his diplomatic standing in Washington shift since President Trump’s return to powerPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to meet with President Trump at the White House this week, the prime minister’s office said in a statement late Saturday, in the second such visit by the Israeli leader since the president’s inauguration in January. Mr. Netanyahu will arrive in Washington afterrenewing Israel’s military campaignagainst Hamas in Gaza late last month, despite efforts by Mr. Trump’s aides to broker a new truce to stop the fighting there and to free more hostages. In addition to the Gaza war, the two leaders are likely to touch on Mr. Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, which include a 17 percent markup on Israeli exports to the United States. Mr. Netanyahu had sought to avert tariff on the eve of Mr. Trump’s announcement by voiding Israeli customs duties on American products — seemingly to no avail. In the statement, Mr. Netanyahu’s office said the two leaders would “discuss the tariff issue, the efforts to return our hostages, Israel-Turkey relations, the Iranian threat,” and other issues, adding that the prime minister is traveling to Washington on Sunday following Mr. Trump’s invitation. Still, Mr. Netanyahu’s visit underscores how the Israeli leader has seen his diplomatic standing in Washington shift since Mr. Trump’s return to power in January. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose relationship with Mr. Netanyahu grew increasingly fraught as the Gaza war wore on, did not meet him in the Oval Office until 2024. Mr. Trump has aligned his Middle East policy to especially benefit Israel and has left little daylight between himself and Mr. Netanyahu. When he entered office for his second term, Mr. Trump made the Israeli prime minister the first foreign leader to be invited to the White House. Two White House officials and an Israeli official previously said the leaders would meet on Monday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The Israeli prime minister has beenin Hungary on a state visit, where he met with the country’s leader, Viktor Orban. During Mr. Netanyahu’s last trip, Mr. Trump made clear he was recommitted to brokering a new diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a primary goal for both leaders. But Mr. Trump appeared to drop support for a Palestinian state, despite pressure from the Saudis. President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel meeting in the Oval Office at the White House in February. Mr. Netanyahu was the first foreign leader Mr. Trump invited to the White House in his second term. Mr. Trump alsodescribed a vision for Gazathat involved a U.S. takeover and the mass exit of Palestinians from the enclave. Experts said the seemingly off-the-cuff proposal to remove Palestinians likely violated international law. It was also widely rejected by Arab nations. Mr. Netanyahu has since called for “voluntary emigration” by Gazans, which critics have denounced as effectively forced displacement. Mr. Trump also canceled sanctions imposed by Mr. Biden on violent West Bank settlers and released weapons to Israel held up by the former president. Israeli forces have been steadily bombarding Gaza andadvancing deeper into the enclavesince the war resumed in late March. Israel has also barred aid from entering Gaza for about a month, in an apparent attempt to pressure Hamas, leading to fears of a worsening humanitarian crisis for Gazans. The Trump administration has blamed Hamas for the cease-fire’s collapse. The truce — which began just before Mr. Trump’s January inauguration — held for about two months before Israel decisively ended it with a deadly bombardment on March 18. Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the cease-fire, which Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, helped broker. The agreement had secured an initial six-week truce for both sides to negotiate a comprehensive deal to free the remaining hostages and end the war, which Israel refused to countenance without an end to Hamas’s rule there.

Trump Envoy Visits Lebanon Amid Fears Over a Shaky Cease-Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/world/middleeast/lebanon-us-israel-hezbollah.html,2025-04-05T10:21:25Z,World,"Morgan Ortagus, President Trump’s deputy Middle East envoy, met with senior officials as tensions with Israel threaten the truce.",United States International Relations; War and Armed Conflicts; Iran-Israel Proxy Conflict; Peace Process; Defense and Military Forces,"Ortagus, Morgan; Aoun, Joseph (1964- ); Trump, Donald J",Lebanon; Israel; Middle East,Hezbollah,"Morgan Ortagus, the U.S. deputy envoy for the Middle East, center, meeting with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam of Lebanon in Beirut on Saturday. Trump Envoy Visits Lebanon Amid Fears Over a Shaky Cease-FireMorgan Ortagus, President Trump’s deputy Middle East envoy, met with senior officials as tensions with Israel threaten the truce. A top Trump administration envoy to the Middle East was in Lebanon on Saturday amid U.S. pressure on the country to crack down on Hezbollah and as tensions with Israel flare despite aU.S.-brokered cease-fire. Morgan Ortagus, President Trump’s deputy Middle East envoy, met with senior officials after strikes over the past two weeks threatened the truce that went into effect in November. The Lebanese government has been trying to rebuild the country in the wake of the devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah in which about 4,000 people in Lebanon were killed and roughly one million displaced. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group that had long been a dominant force in Lebanon, was severely weakened in the war, but still has significant influence. On Saturday morning, Ms. Ortagus met with Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, to discuss issues including the situation in southern Lebanon, according to a statement from Mr. Aoun’s office. Under the cease-fire, the Lebanese military is supposed to take charge in the country’s south, where Hezbollah had long been deeply entrenched. Last week, militants fired rockets at Israel, prompting Israeli forces to bombard the outskirts of Beirut, the capital, and southern Lebanon. Israel laterstruck the area south of Beirut— known as the Dahiya — in what it said was targeting a Hezbollah official, raising further fears that the truce could fall apart. A damaged building in the Dahiya, an area south of Beirut, on Tuesday. Hezbollah denied any connection to the rocket fire. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah has shown appetite for a return to full-scale war. The cease-fire has continued to hold, at least for now, despite the tensions. Ms. Ortagus and Mr. Aoun also discussed ongoing financial overhauls by the new Lebanese government, according to the Lebanese statement. Lebanese officials hope the effort will help bring inincreased foreign assistance— including from the United States — to rebuild the country. The total damage and economic loss from the war is estimated to be $14 billion, and Lebanon needs $11 billion to rebuild, the World Bank said last month, making the conflict the country’s most destructive since its long civil war ended in 1990. Experts say the amount of international aid is likely to depend on whether the Lebanese government can assert its control over the country, including by disarming Hezbollah. Before the war, the armed group was so powerful that it was generally considered a state within a state.

In Canada’s Auto City, Tariffs Have Already Caused a ShutdownHours before the 25 percent tariff on cars made in Canada went into effect, the largest auto plant in Windsor, Ontario, announced it would close for two weeks. Outside City Hall in Windsor, Ontario, it was apparent on Friday morning that at least one American thing wasn’t being boycotted. Fans dressed in Detroit Tigers clothing were gathering at a bus stop to cross the river to take in the team’s home opener. Beyond the opening day festivities, however, it was a week of particularly bad news for Windsor, my hometown. President Trump finally announced a raft of global tariffs on Wednesday, including a new 25 percent tariff on cars assembled outside the United States. Its effect on Windsor was unexpectedly immediate. Hours before the tariff went into effect, Stellantis, the automaker that is the city’s largest employer, told Unifor, the union that represents its workers, that about 3,600 of the union’s members would be laid off for two weeks while the company sorts out its tariff strategy. [Read: Auto Tariffs Take Effect, Putting Pressure on New Car Prices]Canada’s Prime Minister Puts Tariffs on U.S.-Made Cars and Predicts Global UpheavalWith Trump’s Tariffs, the Chasm Between Allies and the U.S. WidensWhile industry executives and auto analysts had warned for months that the tariffs Mr. Trump was threatening would lead to plant shutdowns, they also thought that wouldn’t happen for weeks. The contract between Unifor and Stellantis will mitigate the immediate financial impact of the shutdown on union assembly workers. But most workers at auto parts plants in Canada and the United States, which will also probably close or lay off employees, don’t have the same income protection guarantees. Stellantis and the other companies that make passenger vehicles in Canada — Toyota, Honda, General Motors and Ford — have much to consider. For Canada and Mexico, the United States’ partners in the free trade agreement Mr. Trump signed in his first term, the tariffs will be reduced by the amount of American content in each car, so automakers may be rethinking where they get some of their parts. Auto parts imported from Canada will face similarly reduced tariffs next month, once U.S. officials figure out a way to measure their American content; the task is much more complex for parts than for finished vehicles. Windsor, the capital of Canada’s auto industry, could now be facing its greatest crisis since 2008, when Chrysler Canada, as Stellantis was then known, needed federal and provincial assistance toavoid financial collapseand a total shutdown. To get a sense of the new challenges, I met Windsor’s mayor, Drew Dilkens, at City Hall for a follow-up interview. Whenwe spoke two months ago, he said the biggest problem at the time was the uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump’s trade intentions. Our conversation has been condensed for space and edited for clarity. Mayor Drew Dilkens of Windsor worries that U.S. tariffs will make Chinese auto parts more attractive. What is happening at Stellantis? Stellantis is saying, Let’s see what the inventory looks like and let it adjust for two weeks. Let us do the math and figure out what it is now going to cost us to make the vehicle. What do we have to sell it for, and will people buy it? What do you expect the short-term consequences to be? Demand for vehicles will fall because prices will go up. Which means you will need fewer people to build fewer vehicles. And you’re going to have this cascading of layoffs throughout the auto industry in the part sector that is not going to be a pleasant experience. Will that mean the gradual end of assembly plants and parts-making in Canada? I’m still optimistic that with the exchange rate difference between the U.S. and Canada — and given the number of parts companies that exist here — it’s not practical to think that the U.S. can repatriate all of that. I think the bigger risk is that getting parts from China will become more attractive, even with the tariff rate that is now in place. Is there anything any politician in Canada can do to end the U.S. tariffs in the short term? We’re in a tough place, there’s no doubt about it. And I don’t think we ever want to be in this place again. This shows the risk for Canada from being so reliant on the United States as a trading partner. Still, I think the U.S. will always be our largest trading partner by virtue of proximity and its buying power. But this decision by the president will have people looking at other markets and contemplating how they can better mitigate that risk. Election 2025The Trump tariffs again dominated the election campaign this week. While Mark Carney pledged to create a government-ownedaffordable housing development agency, Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, offered atax break for investorswho put their gains back into Canadian investments, and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democrats proposed reviving“victory bonds”to bolster the economy during the trade battle in the United States.

How ​South Korea’s Democracy Prevailed Over a Reckless LeaderAnalysisThe rise and fall of Yoon Suk Yeol exposed a vulnerability in South Korean democracy, but also a resilience. Its people were always ready to fight for it. When Yoon Suk Yeol was running for president, hehad the word “king” written on his palm. South Koreans dismissed — and ridiculed — it as a shamanistic ritual that reflected his desire for top government office. But ​after his inauguration in May 2022, it didn’t take long for ​them to see an authoritarian streak in Mr. Yoon. On short notice, he ​moved the presidential office from the graceful Blue House to a drab military building. When he turned 63 in December 2023, his security teamsang songshonoring him as “a president sent from Heaven” and describing his “845,280 minutes” in office so far as “a time blessed.” Two months later, a college student who protested Mr. Yoon’s decision to cut government budgets for scientific research wasgagged and dragged outby the president’s bodyguards. When journalists published what he called“fake news,”prosecutors raided their homes and newsrooms to collect evidence. Mr. Yoon kept pushing the envelope, until he made his fatal mistake: ​On Dec. 3, hedeclared martial law​,threatening a deeply cherished part of South Korean life: democracy. Passengers at a bus station in Seoul watched Mr. Yoon declaring martial law on the night of Dec. 3. To​ South Koreans, democracy has never been something given​; it was fought for and won through decades of struggle against authoritarian leaders at the cost of torture, imprisonment and bloodshed​. All the major political milestones in South Korea — an end to dictatorship, the introduction of free elections, the ouster of abusive leaders — were achieved after citizens took to the streets. So when people saw troops sent by Mr. Yoon storming the National Assembly to seize the legislature by force, their response was immediate. But unlike those who fought government repression in the ​1950s through the ​’80s, South Koreans protesting in recent months had ​democratic institutions on their side. The current Constitution, written in 1987 after a huge pro-democracy uprising, gave the National Assembly the power to vote down martial law and ​impeach presidents. The Constitutional Court, created under ​that Constitution, got to decide whether to remove or reinstate an impeached president. And leaders democratically elected under that Constitution imprisoned those who had earlier taken power by military force​. Younger generations, including the paratroopers Mr. Yoon sent to seize the Assembly ​in December, grew up learning of that history throughbox office-hit moviesand novelists likethe Nobel laureate Han Kang. On Dec. 3, the troops hesitated before angry citizens blocking them with bare hands, allowing time for lawmakers, including some members of Mr. Yoon’s own party, to gather and vote to lift his martial law decree. The Assembly then impeached him, on Dec. 14. And on Friday, the Constitutional Court’s eight justices, including those appointed by Mr. Yoon or his party, unanimously upheld that impeachment, putting an end to his military rebellion. Woo Won-shik, the National Assembly, speaker declaring the passage of an impeachment motion against Mr. Yoon on Dec. 14. To one observer, these events were a victory for the democratic institutions created​ in the late 1980s. “The response to Yoon’s attempted coup d’état displayed the maturity of Korean democracy — first of all, the resilience of civil society, which reacted immediately and massively to oppose the coup, most notably with the passion of Korean youth who were not alive in the 1980s and experienced the dangers of a return to autocratic rule for the first time,” said Daniel Sneider, a former journalist who covered South Korea back then and is now a lecturer at Stanford University. “The fact that it was a unanimous decision of the Constitutional Court, with conservative appointees joining the decision, was a very important expression of not only the clarity of the case, but also the ability to overcome ideological polarization,” Mr. Sneider said. Mr. Yoon’s power grab also exposed the vulnerabilities of democracy in South Korea. If such a thing can happen in a nation long considered an exemplary case of democratization in Asia,scholars warned, it can happen elsewhere, too.​Despite his removal, the deep polarization that led up to Mr. Yoon’s declaration of martial law persists. ​ ​The partisan struggle between the left and right is likely to intensify in the next two months as the country lurches toward a presidential election. But the past four months have also shown the resilience of South Korean democracy. Many people in Seoul on Friday reacted joyfully after South Korea’s top court removed Mr. Yoon from power. ​Until Mr. Yoon came along, few South Koreans thought that a return to military rule was possible in their country, a peaceful democracy known globally for its cars, smartphones and K-dramas. Many of those who joined protests calling for Mr. Yoon’s ouster in recent weeks said they had been more proud of their democracy than of their cultural exports like the boy band BTS or the Netflix hit “Squid Game.”When Mr. Yoon hurt that pride, he picked a fight he couldn’t win. During rallies, people shared a video clip of former PresidentKim Dae-jung,an iconic figure in South Korea’s democratization struggle. “Democracy is not free,” Mr. Kim saidin the clip. “You must shed blood, sweat and tears for it.”If the Constitutional Court had voted to reinstate Mr. Yoon, South Korea would have seen a “second wave of democratization movement” and “a second Gwangju,” said Cho Gab-je, a prominent South Korean journalist who has covered the nation’s political evolution since 1971, referring to the brutally suppressed uprising against martial law inthe southern city of Gwangjuin 1980. “We had our share of martial law, but Yoon Suk Yeol was the first president to send armed troops into Parliament,” Mr. Cho said. The scene near the National Assembly in Seoul hours after Mr. Yoon declared martial law. People rushed to the scene, blocking soldiers and giving lawmakers a chance to vote down the martial law decree. Mr. Yoon was once a hero among South Koreans. He built his national image as an uncompromising prosecutor when he helped imprison two former presidents for corruption. But he proved disastrous as a politician — unable to engage in the give and take of compromise with the opposition, which controlled the National Assembly. He was accused of filling his presidential staff with officials too timid to speak up. He was nicknamed “Mr. 59 Minutes,” because that was how long he was said to speak during an hourlong meeting. He rarely apologized for hiswife’s scandalsor even fordeadly disasters. He used his veto power to kill opposition bills. The opposition slashed his budgets and impeached an unprecedented number of political appointees in his government. “A player busy playing on the field doesn’t look at the electronic scoreboard,” Mr. Yoon once said when asked about his dismal approval ratings. Such an attitude allowed him to push unpopular efforts, such asimproving tieswith Japan anddrastically increasingthe number of doctors. But even many who sympathized with his struggle against the opposition didn’t see martial law coming. “Koreans do not want the 1980s option, when martial law and tear gas made forcibly disappeared people painful to so many families,” said Alexis Dudden, a professor of history at the University of Connecticut. “Yoon and his advisers missed the mark of reading today’s South Korea in many obvious ways.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

It is $218 billion, not $218 million. President Trump’s antagonism toward Europe has been public for decades. Steven Erlanger is the chief diplomatic correspondent, Europe, and reported from Berlin. The Predatory Friend: Trump Treats Europe as Anything but an AllyNews AnalysisPresident Trump has shown a willingness to fracture the trans-Atlantic alliance with his tariffs and demands for higher military spending. It was not long ago that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was marshaling European allies to resist the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He illustrated the point that a top American diplomat, R. Nicholas Burns,recently summarizedas the way the United States wins the global competition for power and prosperity: “Be nice to your allies.”President Trump clearly has a different view. His antagonism toward Europe has been public for decades, seeing allies as economic competitors and geopolitical parasites. And his decision on Thursday to impose controversially calculated tariffs on America’s partners, including Ukraine — but not on Russia or North Korea — laid bare his willingness to fracture a trans-Atlantic alliance that has largely kept the peace in Europe for 80 years. Combined with Mr. Trump’s demand that NATO allies spend up to 5 percent of their gross domestic product on the military and his expressed desires to seize territory from Denmark, a NATO ally, the tariffs highlight long-term damage to American relations with Europe that are unlikely to ever be fully repaired. “The tariffs are another addition to the perception and assessment in Europe that the U.S. under Donald Trump is not only an unreliable partner, but a partner that cannot be trusted in any way,” said Guntram Wolff, an economist and a former director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “That changes 80 years of postwar history, when the trans-Atlantic alliance was the core of the Western world and of the global multilateral system.”As much as Brussels will try to preserve some of these key relationships, Mr. Wolff added, “It cannot on its own underpin the global system.”Mr. Trump’s effort to transform the global order also seems to benefit Russia, NATO’s chief antagonist, by potentially weakening the Kremlin’s adversaries in the rest of Europe, though plummeting oil prices on Friday hit Russia as well. European leaders at a meeting about Ukraine. Mr. Trump expects European allies to take the main responsibility for both their security and Ukraine’s. “There seems to be no order in the disorder,”said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, on Thursday. “No clear path through the complexity and chaos that is being created as all U.S. trading partners are hit,” while “hurting the most vulnerable citizens.”Europeans are increasingly aware that Mr. Trump, unmoderated and even encouraged by more ideologically compatible and loyal advisers in his second term, intends to follow through on his intentions to distance the United States from Europe. But “the intensity, speed, aggression and imperialism of this administration has been a surprise to some people,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Many European governments thought they could navigate Mr. Trump’s demands through transactional methods, such as buying more weapons and liquefied natural gas — major American exports — and doing more burden-sharing. The developments of the past weeks show the limits of that approach, including the Trump administration’s uneven application of tariffs on Britain and the European Union and its demand for Ukrainian minerals in return for years of military aid. “The challenge for Europe is how to deal with a predatory America willing to use the vulnerability of allies to extort them, whether it’s a mineral deal in Ukraine or attempts to annex Greenland or the open way Trump is trying to divide Britain from the E.U. with differential trade deals,” Mr. Leonard said. For now, the European Union is holding together, in large part because Mr. Trump applied the same 20 percent tariffs to all its 27 member states, including more ideologically friendly countries like Hungary, Slovakia and Italy. But Washington may also choose to use differentiated tariffs on certain sectors to pressure individual countries, like Denmark, over issues like Greenland. Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. Mr. Trump has expressed his desire for the United States to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. There is a general assumption that the tariffs are a prelude to a deal, as Mr. Trump’s son Eric urgedin a messageon X. “I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,” he wrote. “The first to negotiate will win — the last will absolutely lose.”Sophia Besch, a German analyst at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, sees two fundamentally different messages from the Trump administration. “It’s not clear whether this is an opening offer to negotiate, or whether they really are remaking the world, with no interest in repairing it,” she said. “Different people around Trump are pursuing different things.”The issues of tariffs and security are distinct but hardly separate, Ms. Besch and others said, displaying Mr. Trump’s willingness to use American power crudely and even uncaringly against friends, their economies and the poor, who are most likely to suffer from inflation and higher consumer taxes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tried to be reassuring in Brussels this past week, at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, as he mixed emollience with warning. He denounced “hysteria and hyperbole” in the media and insisted that Mr. Trump supports the alliance and its commitment to collective defense. “President Trump’s made clear he supports NATO,” Mr. Rubio said. “We’re going to remain in NATO.”But not any NATO. Mr. Trump expects European allies to take the main responsibility for their own security and for Ukraine’s as America turns toward Asia, Mr. Rubio warned. “He’s against a NATO that does not have the capabilities that it needs to fulfill the obligations that the treaty imposes upon each and every member state.”People protesting last month in Kyiv about changes to U.S. policy over Ukraine. Yet the economic impact of the tariffs, expected to cause inflation and lower economic growth, will make it only harder for European allies to increase military spending to the 3.5 percent of G.D.P. goal that NATO is considering for its summit in July, let alone the 5 percent that Mr. Trump has demanded. For Germany alone, a rich country, the impact will be considerable, with Germany’s finance minister, Jörg Kukies, estimating a 15 percent reduction in German exports to the United States. He says Germany will continue to try to negotiate better terms with Washington, even as Brussels retaliates forcefully if carefully for the bloc. Still, the German Economic Institute estimates the possible costs of these tariffs to Germany alone at around 200 billion euros ($218 billion) over the next four years. Europeans will now search for other markets and more free-trade deals, like the ones it has with Canada and Mexico, said Maggie Switek, an economist and director of research at the Milken Institute. “There is still room for cooperation with the U.S. and U.S. companies as we think through how to navigate this new situation and new American theory,” she said. But for Moscow, which does little unsanctioned trade with the United States, the tariff blow to American allies was another gift. The former president of Russia Dmitri Medvedevcrowed happilyon X about the damage done. Invoking an old Chinese proverb, he said Russia would “sit by the river, waiting for the body of the enemy to float by.

Mr. Hamra is working with Syrian American advocacy groups in lobbying the United States to lift sanctions. Reporting from WashingtonSurprising Allies for Syria’s New Leaders: Some Jews Who Fled Long AgoA group of Jews who left Syria decades ago wants sanctions relief for a government with former ties to Al Qaeda, despite wariness from other Jewish groups and from Israel. Henry Hamra left Damascus as a teenager more than 30 years ago and never stopped pining for home. “It was my dream to go back,” he told lawmakers in Washington on Tuesday. In February, shortly after the Assad regime was toppled, Mr. Hamra and his father, Rabbi Yosef Hamra, finally returned with other Jews to see ancient sites that are remnants of many centuries of Syrian Jewish history. The new government of President Ahmed al-Shara, a former rebel leader with jihadist roots, helped make the trip happen. The visit was hopeful, but it also broke Mr. Hamra’s heart. Fourteen years of civil war, and a thicket offinancial restrictions imposed by the U.S. governmentand others, have crippled Syria, physically and economically. The sites he ached to see are in disrepair or destroyed, including the ancient Jobar synagogue and a Damascus cemetery that is the resting place of a prominent 16th- and 17th-century mystic. “There’s a lot of work that has to be done and I think the only thing that’s stopping the whole thing is the sanctions,” Mr. Hamra said in a meeting with Representative Jimmy Panetta, Democrat of California. The Hamras have joined Syrian American advocacy groups, initially formed in opposition to the government of Bashar al-Assad, in lobbying the United States to lift sanctions on the new government. The family, prominent members of Brooklyn’s large Syrian Jewish community, reached out to those groups for help making their visit to Syria, and were in turn enlisted to help make the case for sanctions relief, in a play calculated to intrigue American officials. But Marshall Whittman, spokesman for the pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said, “Any change in policy must be based on a sustained demonstration of positive behavior from the new Syrian government.”Israel remains deeply wary of Mr. al-Shara, a former member of Al Qaeda. Since the fall of the Assad regime, the Israeli military has deployed troops in southern Syria and carried out hundreds of airstrikes. Israel has defended the moves as necessary for its security, but Syria has accused it of trying to destabilize the country and many Syrians worry about a long-term occupation. Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, speaking with Mr. Hamra, left; Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syria Emergency Task Force, right; and Rabbi Yosef Hamra. Mouaz Moustafa, who leads the Syria Emergency Task Force, an American nonprofit that facilitatedthe Jewish delegation’s visit to Syria, said he had expected the trip to generate interest, precisely because Jews are seemingly unlikely champions of the new government. Mr. Hamra said he feared that without sanctions relief, Syria would not recover — and he would not be able to fulfill another dream that once seemed impossible, to restore what remains of Syrian Jewish history. Fewer than 10 Jews live in Syria, according to Abraham Marcus, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies Syrian Jewry. A century ago, there were tens of thousands. Over more than two millenniums under Persians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Ottomans, the numbers fluctuated but, Mr. Marcus said, “there is a history of communities that were successful and prosperous and in most cases did not suffer from discrimination.”Around Israel’s establishment in 1948, Syrian Jews faced hostility and many fled until the government imposed emigration and travel restrictions. In 1992, President Hafez al-Assad — the father of Bashar al-Assad, who was overthrown last year — loosened the limits. Few Jews stayed. “So little is left now,” the Syrian chief rabbi, Ibrahim al-Hamra — brother of Rabbi Yosef Hamra —said in 1994, before he emigrated, too. He died in Israel in 2021. Now, his relatives are making the rounds in Washington with Mr. Moustafa, who said they had met with people at the National Security Council, the State Department and on Capitol Hill. A State Department spokeswoman confirmed that a meeting took place; the White House did not respond to a request for comment. Maissa Kabbani, a Syrian Muslim who sought asylum in the United States decades ago, joined the Jewish delegation to Syria. Western officials have expressed concerns that Syria’s new rulers are not committed to pluralism and protection of minorities, despite their pledges, so she said she saw the visit as an opportunity to prove a point. The symbolic value of the visit was also not lost on the Syrian Foreign Ministry, which welcomed the group and provided guidance, drivers and security, she said. Sanctions relief for Syria will not come quickly, if at all, but some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle aremaking the case to the Trump administration. Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last month, arguing that “broad restrictions” aimed at a defunct regime “now risk undermining U.S. national security objectives and impeding Syria’s reconstruction.”Mr. Wilson met with the Hamras on Tuesday and said he was “encouraged” by their accounts of interactions with the new Syrian government. “Obviously, the terrorist connections, we should be concerned,” he said. “But people change, OK. As we see, whole countries change.”Later, Mr. Wilsonposted on social mediaabout the “important meeting” with Syrian Jews. “I agree with them,” he said. “We must ease sanctions on the Syrian people to give them a chance to live.”Chemical Weapons: Inspectors saymore than 100 sites could remain in Syriaafter thefall of the longtime president, Bashar al-Assad, raising concerns about who controls the deadly toxins. Surprising Allies: A group of Jews who left Syria decades agowants sanctions relief for a government with former ties to Al Qaeda, despite wariness from other Jewish groups and from Israel. An Elusive Unified Military: ​Themilitias that control the Druse religious minority’s heartlandhave resisted the new government’s attempts to bring all armed groups under its control. Being Wanted in Syria: ​The ousted Assad dictatorship kept lists of millions of wanted people. Syrians are openly asking whether they “have a name” on any of those lists and aresharing the news proudly.

"Trump Weighs In, Making Marine Le Pen’s Case Part of the Politics of Grievance",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/trump-marine-le-pen-conviction.html,2025-04-04T14:52:22Z,World,"The American president cast the French politician’s conviction as an example of far-right persecution, ignoring ample evidence against her.",Embezzlement; Right-Wing Extremism and Alt-Right; Politics and Government; Polls and Public Opinion; United States International Relations,"Le Pen, Marine; Trump, Donald J",France,National Rally (France),"Marine Le Pen, a far-right French politician, was a leading candidate to become the country’s next president, but has now been barred from running for public office for five years. Reporting from ParisTrump Weighs In, Making Marine Le Pen’s Case Part of the Politics of GrievanceThe American president cast the French politician’s conviction as an example of far-right persecution, ignoring ample evidence against her. “FREE MARINE LE PEN!”With this blunt call, a strange one in that the French far-right leader is walking the streets of Paris, President Trump has waded into the politics of an ally, condemningher conviction this weekon embezzlement charges and her disqualification from running for public office. The conviction was “another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech,” Mr. Trumpwrote on Truth Social. Elon Musk, his billionaire aide, drove home the point: “Free Le Pen!” Mr. Muskechoed on his social media platform X. More than an extraordinary American intervention in French politics, the statements ignored the overwhelming evidence arrayed against Ms. Le Pen, who was convicted of helping orchestrate over many years a system to divert European taxpayers’ money illicitly to offset the acute financial difficulties of her National Rally party in France. For the American president and his team, as well as for an angry chorus of Le Pen supporters at home, her case has become part of a vigorous campaign to undermine the separation of powers and the rule of law. Vice President JD Vance and others have accused liberals of using the law to stifle the far right and quash democratic choice. Ms. Le Pen last year. She became the face of France’s far right after taking over the party from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Ms. Le Pen will speak ata big National Rally demonstrationSunday in Paris under the banner “Let’s Save Democracy!” The National Rally was founded in 1972 as the National Front, an antisemitic party of fascist roots, by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. It was long seen as a direct threat to the democratic rule of the Fifth Republic, before Ms. Le Pen embarked on a makeover. She is a front-runner in the 2027 French presidential election, but will not be able to run unless she secures a more lenient ruling on appeal. The Paris Court of Appeal, expediting the process, has said a decision is expected to be reached by summer 2026. It is far from clear, however, that this verdict would go her way. The court sentenced Ms. Le Pen to four years in prison, with two of those suspended, and the other two to be served under a form of house arrest. Under this verdict, she would not be put behind bars. For now, Ms. Le Pen’s appeal puts her sentence on hold. Mr. Trump, who said France had put Mr. Le Pen “in prison” and censored her, neither of which is true, compared her treatment to his own at the hands of a “group of Lunatics and Losers.” He faced indictments, convictions and criminal cases on his way to winning the presidency last year. “They get her on a minor charge that she probably knew nothing about,” Mr. Trump said. “Sounds like a ‘bookkeeping error’ to me.”In fact, the reams of evidence produced at trial and detailed inthe more than 150-page verdictplaced Ms. Le Pen at the heart of an elaborate system developed over three legislatures from 2004 to 2016 that used no-show “assistant” jobs at the European Parliament to finance her party. The people in these “jobs” worked for the party in roles like Ms. Le Pen’s security guard or personal assistant. She has denied all charges, saying that the people involved were political aides, not European Parliament employees, even though they were paid with the assembly’s funds. Her sweeping dismissal of volumes of evidence was viewed as cavalier by the presiding judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, one reason she considered her capable of similar acts if not barred from running for public office. Ms. Le Pen was found guilty of embezzlement and has denied any wrongdoing in the case. According to the court ruling, on June 22, 2014, Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, a former National Rally lawmaker at the European Parliament, wrote to Wallerand de Saint-Just, the party’s former treasurer. “What Marine is asking us to do is the equivalent of signing for fictitious jobs,” he said. “I understand Marine’s reasons, but we’re going to get burned because we’ll certainly be scrutinized as such a large group.”That same month, Mr. Saint-Just wrote to Ms. Le Pen, portraying the party’s grave financial situation, the court said. “In 2013, monthly expenses were 100,000 euros more than expected,” as a result of missions, receptions, travel and conferences, he said. “We will only get by if we make significant savings thanks to the European Parliament.”Those “savings” amounted to close to $4.8 million over the time the scheme ran its course. At the same time, in 2014, Ms. Le Pen, using her ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, had secured in extremis a loan from a Russian bank to bail out the party. French courts, acting on laws passed andvigorously supported by Ms. Le Penover the past 15 years in response to public outrage over political corruption, have hardened their positions on cases involving prominent politicians, including Nicolas Sarkozy, a former president. The2017 presidential bid of François Fillon, a former prime minister, was derailed by an investigation into no-show parliamentary jobs involving his wife and several children. He was convicted in 2020 but his case is still going through the appeals process. While Ms. Le Pen’s conviction and disqualification conform with these developments, they are unique in barring a leading presidential candidate. This has ignited political passions and led to an intense debate pitting “democracy” and the “people” against the law, even if a state stripped of the rule of law is almost certainly headed toward autocracy. “The verdict is heavy, a severe decision given Ms. Le Pen’s long disqualification,” said Anne-Charlène Bezzina, a senior lecturer in public law at the University of Rouen. “There’s never been anything like it in the Fifth Republic. But is it anti-democratic? Evidently not. A functioning justice system independent of political power is the sign of a healthy democracy.”Anopinion pollby the Ouest-France newspaper and the Ifop polling institute this week found that 64 percent of French people supported a court’s ability to immediately bar convicted politicians from running for office. At the same time, apollby Sud Radio and Ifop found that 49 percent of people believe Ms. Le Pen should be allowed to run for president.

Skeletons of the Roman Empire Are Found Under a Vienna Soccer Field,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/roman-empire-grave-vienna.html,2025-04-04T13:44:33Z,World,"Archaeologists found the remains of at least 129 people, many of them bearing the injuries of battle, dating to when Rome battled Germanic people nearly 2,000 years ago.",Roman Civilization; Historic Buildings and Sites; Skeletons,,Danube River; Vienna (Austria),,"People work on the excavation of a Roman mass grave from the end of the 1st century A.D., in the Simmering district of Vienna, in November. Skeletons of the Roman Empire Are Found Under a Vienna Soccer FieldArchaeologists found the remains of at least 129 people, many of them bearing the injuries of battle, dating to when Rome battled Germanic people nearly 2,000 years ago. Under a soccer field in a Vienna neighborhood along the Danube, archaeologists have found a mass grave dating to the era when the Roman Empire was battling Germanic tribes almost 2,000 years ago, experts announced this week. The grave was discovered in October by a construction company doing renovations for the field in Vienna’s Simmering district, a team of archaeologists and historians at the Vienna Museum said in announcing its findings. The extraordinary discovery was tied to what they called a “catastrophic” military event, possibly one where Roman troops were badly defeated and fled the site quickly. Radiocarbon dating traced the bones to approximately A.D. 80 to 234 — a period in which more than a dozen Roman emperors ruled, including Domitian and Trajan, who clashed with ancient Germanic people in the region. An analysis of other items found in the grave, including an iron dagger, lance points, scale armor and a cheek piece of a helmet, helped confirm the time period. Near the foot of one skeleton, the archaeologists also discovered shoe nails that came from distinctive Roman military shoes called caligae. The discovery of such skeletal remains is exceedingly rare, experts said, in part because ancient Romans almost exclusively practiced cremation until the third century A.D. “For all of middle Europe from the first century, we don’t have any unburned, uncremated human remains,” said Michaela Binder, the lead anthropologist on the project. “So aside from the military aspect, it is an absolute unique chance to study the life histories of people in the first century A.D.”She added, “We have the unique opportunity to study the lives of normal Roman soldiers.”Martin Mosser, an archaeologist for the Vienna Department of Urban Archaeology who worked on the project, said that because Romans took great care with ritualized burials and cremation of bodies, the remains began to tell a story of what happened to the men buried there. “The undignified nature of the burial site along with the deadly wounds found on each individual suggests a catastrophic military confrontation, possibly followed by a hasty retreat,” he said. There are historical accounts of battles between Germanic tribes and the Romans on the border of the Roman Empire at the end of the first century, and the team called the grave the first physical evidence of such fighting in the area of modern-day Vienna. The remains could represent the start of the metropolis’s history, the team said — theorizing that a Roman defeat could have led to the expansion of a small military base a few miles away. “It suggests a concrete reason for the buildup of Vindobona into a full-scale legionary fortress, which would take us to the founding moment of Vienna,” Mr. Mosser said, referring to the military base. The evidence astonished the team. Mr. Mosser said that before this evidence surfaced, no Roman evidence had been found in this area of the city. “Nor could we have expected a Roman battlefield to be located in the Vienna area,” he said. The remains in the grave belonged to at least 129 people, the archaeologists found, but the total number might exceed 150 as some bones were found intermixed. All of the dead examined so far were men, mostly between 20 and 30 years old, and many had suffered ghastly injuries, particularly to their skulls, torsos and pelvises. A skull with a sharp trauma found at an excavation of a Roman mass grave from the end of the 1st century A.D. in the Simmering district of Vienna, Austria, last Thursday. Experts said the wounds seemed to be from weapons like spears, daggers, swords and iron bolts from ranged weapons, such as crossbows, which suggested the dead were not executed but had perished in battle. The bodies appeared to have been buried hastily, with many found lying on their stomachs or sides with limbs intertwined. They were most likely professional Roman soldiers, according to David Potter, a professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the research. “I think we’ve got another moment reflecting a Roman defeat and a burial of troops after the fact,” he said, drawing parallels to how the bodies of Roman soldiers were handled after their forces suffered a brutaldefeatat the hands of Germanic warriors in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in A.D. 9. “You get a sense for the nature of battle from the injuries that these poor people have sustained,” he said, adding, “the other side had a lot of big clubs.”The team in Vienna said its experts were only beginning their research and that DNA analysis could provide more information about the origins and living conditions of the people buried in the grave. The museum’s report also laid out plans to look more into the objects found in the grave. On a personal level, Mr. Mosser said the case struck a chord. “With so many young individuals buried so irreverently, one inevitably thinks about the horrific wars of the more recent past as well as the present,” he said, adding, “The unfortunate conclusion: Humans have not become any wiser.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Adam Rasgon reported from Jerusalem and Ameera Harouda reported from Doha, QatarIsraeli Military Expands Ground Operations in Gaza CityIsrael said the operation had killed a militant who was “likely personally involved in the abduction” of the Bibas family on Oct. 7. The Israeli military pressed deeper into northern Gaza by ground on Friday after issuinga seriesof evacuation orders calling on Palestinians to flee, part of its escalating offensive against Hamas in the war-battered Gaza Strip. The expansion of ground operations came after the Palestinian health authorities said on Thursday that dozens of people, including children, werekilled in Israeli strikeson a school turned shelter in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City. On Friday, the Israeli military said the strikes were targeting well-known militants in a Hamas command and control center, without naming them. The evacuation orders have brought renewed hardship to Palestinians who had already endured displacement from their homes and miserable conditions during the first 15 months of the war. A shaky two-month cease-fire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March after the two sides failed to reach an agreement to extend it, ending a brief respite for Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli military has sinceembarked on a major bombing campaignand seized territory in Gaza in a tactic that Israeli officials have said was intended to compel Hamas to release more hostages. As the Israeli military operation expanded, Hamas’s military wing on Friday appeared to threaten the remaining Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza. In a statement that did not mention the plight of its own people, Hamas said its fighters were holding some captives in the evacuation zones under “strict security measures that are extremely dangerous to their lives.”The armed group has in the past threatened the well-being of hostages in the face of Israeli bombardments. The military said its recent campaign had dismantled weapons infrastructure and killed militants, including Mohammed Awad, whom it described as a senior military commander in the Mujahedeen Brigades, a small armed group in Gaza. The military said that Mr. Awad had taken part in Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and was “likely personally involved  in the abduction and brutal murders of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas,” though it did not explain how it had come to that conclusion. Mrs. Bibas and her two young children became symbols for many Israelis of their suffering on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 abducted to Gaza. Avichay Adraee, the military’s Arabic-language spokesman, said in a post late Thursday on social media that he was providing a “final” warning before a new attack, urging people to relocate southward. Mr. Adraee suggested that militant groups were operating among civilians. A tent camp erected for displaced people near a garbage dump in Gaza City last month. Palestinians carrying their belongings through the Shajaiye neighborhood on Thursday. While many people have complied with such evacuation orders from the military during the most recent Israeli campaign, others have chosen to stay in their homes or shelters, saying they could not bear being displaced or that they have nowhere else to go. On Friday, the military said its troops began operating in the neighborhood of Shajaiye in eastern Gaza City in order “to expand the security zone,” referring to what it has characterized as a buffer zone next to Israel’s border with Gaza. During the first 15 months of war, much of Shajaiye wastransformed into a wastelandas the Israeli military fought Hamas, with buildings demolished, roads ripped up and utilities infrastructure ruined. Palestinian health authorities — who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants — said the bodies of 27 people killed in the Tuffah strike had arrived at the hospital. Multiple videos verified by The New York Times show an explosion and its chaotic aftermath at the Dar al-Arqam school, where civilians were sheltering.

Khamis Elessi, a volunteer doctor at the hospital, said successive waves of wounded people arrived in the emergency room, overwhelming medical staff. “It was a terrifying scene,” he said in phone interview. “People were thrown on the ground.”Dr. Elessi, 56, said he was stunned by the number of wounded children. “I was brought to tears,” he said. “One boy kept asking me: Why did they hit me?”One of those killed was the grandson of Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s top negotiator based in Qatar, the Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV channel reported. Alaa Hamada, 36, said she and her children were sheltering at Dar al-Arqam when the strikes pounded into the school turned shelter. “What happened can’t be described in words,” she said. “It was a miracle that we survived.”Israel has previously targeted schools being used as shelters, contending that Hamas militants were operating command centers in them. Hamas has denied such claims in the past. The United Nations has said that Israeli strikes on schools probably violated the law by causing disproportionate harm to noncombatants. More than 1,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the collapse of the cease-fire on March 18 and more than 50,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry. The bodies of 86 people killed by Israel arrived at hospitals across Gaza on Thursday, according to the health ministry. Nader Ibrahim,Ameera HaroudaandAaron Boxermanreporting.

"Will Trump’s Tariffs Drive Europe Into China’s Arms, or Into a Fight?",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/trump-tariffs-china.html,2025-04-04T11:24:36Z,World,"The European Union is deepening other trade partnerships as U.S. relations sour.

The E.U. imposed higher tariffs on China-made electrical vehicles last year, but China’s commerce ministry said at a news conference on Thursday that the two sides had agreed to restart negotiations. Reporting from BrusselsWill Trump’s Tariffs Drive Europe Into China’s Arms, or Into a Fight? The European Union is deepening other trade partnerships as U.S. relations sour. But with China, the relationship could get closer — or more combative. President Trump’s tariffs mean that companies across the European Union and around the world are at risk of losing access to the world’s largest consumer market. Naturally, they are looking for the next big thing. Statistically speaking, that would mean China. The E.U. has thesecond-largest consumer marketin the world behind America; China is third. But China and the E.U. have not exactly been cozy in recent years. Europe has regularly blasted China for overproducing and dumping artificially cheap products on the global market, and European leaders have criticized China’sstance towardRussia’s war in Ukraine, among other political and social issues. Still, the E.U. is staring down 20 percent across-the-board tariffs in the United States, and even higher levies on major products like cars and trucks. China is confronting rates in excess of 50 percent. There’s a small chance that those tariffs could drive the two large economies closer together, experts said — an unintended consequence at a time when Mr. Trump’s America has been trying to weaken China. There have been early hints of a thaw. The E.U. imposed higher tariffs on Chinese-made electrical vehicles last year, but China’s commerce ministry said at a news conference on Thursday that the two sideshad agreed to restartnegotiations. Olof Gill, an E.U. spokesman for trade, said officials had agreed to “continue discussions” on electric vehicle supply chains and take a “fresh look” at pricing. But there is an even greater possibility that this moment will tear the E.U. and China further apart. China’s reduced access to American consumers could prod its companies to send even more cheap metals, chemicals and other products in Europe’s direction, worsening concerns about dumping and heightening already-high tensions on other matters. Relations between the two nations could deteriorate, widening the damage as America blows up longstanding global trade patterns. “There’s two ways that this could play,” said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies in Brussels. “Europe is in a really tough position.”President Trump and Howard Lutnick, the U.S. secretary of commerce, explaining the new tariffs on Thursday in Washington. Europe is responding quickly to Mr. Trump’s trade war. Itplans to finalizenext week initial lists of goods destined for retaliatory tariffs, and officials have promised more will come. It is also trying to negotiate to get rid of the tariffs, with the E.U. trade commissioner set to meet his U.S. counterparts through teleconference on Friday. If the U.S. tariffs are not quickly negotiated away, Europe — and China — could find themselves looking for new consumers. Another big part of Europe’s strategy? Making new friends. Since late last year, the bloc has worked to expand relations withIndia,South American countriesSouth AfricaSouth KoreaandMexico. It has also drawn nearer to Canada and the United Kingdom, especially on defense issues. Yet the U.S. is difficult to replace with one-off trade deals elsewhere because of the sheer size of its consumer market: $18.8 trillion in 2024, according to World Bank data. The E.U. trails at about $10 trillion, China at about $7 trillion. America is the E.U.’smost importantexport market. Filling a U.S.-shaped void with China, while mathematically obvious, would be tricky. China and the E.U. have been moving further apart in recent years, withdecliningtrade flows, and regular accusations by the E.U. that China is using trade practices that distort the market. Europe’s dilemma when it comes to China has been on full display in the way that European leaders have talked about the Asian nation in recent months. “We must engage constructively with China,” Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the E.U.’s executive arm, said during a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January. She talked about expanding trade and investment ties “where possible.”But when Mr. Trump’s tariff announcements came out this week, a flood of cheap goods coming from Asia was an immediate concern. “We will also be watching closely what indirect effects these tariffs could have, because we cannot absorb global overcapacity, nor will we accept dumping on our market,” Ms. von der Leyen warned inher televised responseon Thursday to the Trump tariffs. The E.U. and China areto have a summitthis year, though details on timing and location have yet to be determined. Noah Barkin, a Berlin-based visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and a specialist on China, said: “Trump’s tariffs are likely to divert a massive amount of Chinese exports into the E.U.”“The bloc is likely to throw its entire trade policy toolbox at Beijing in response,” he added. “It is difficult to envision a scenario where this ends well for the E.U.-China relationship.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

But the country remains deeply divided.","Politics and Government; Decisions and Verdicts; Martial Law; Impeachment; Demonstrations, Protests and Riots",Yoon Suk-yeol,South Korea,,"At a rally of supporters of Mr. Yoon, there was loud booing after the Constitutional Court delivered its ruling. Many of them left, dejected, soon after. Reporting from SeoulSouth Korea Removes Its Impeached President and Regains DirectionThe country’s Constitutional Court formally ended the presidency of Yoon Suk Yeol for declaring martial law, ending months of turmoil. But the country remains deeply divided. South Korea’s top court ended months of political turmoil when it unanimously decided to remove the impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday, clearing the way for the country to elect a new leader. But the political crisis that Mr. Yoon triggered with his misjudged declaration of martial law in December — and his ensuing impeachment by the National Assembly — exposed a deep fissure in South Korea’s polarized politics that may prove harder to heal. For months, protesters for and against Mr. Yoon have taken over the streets in Seoul. The country must continue without an elected leader before the elections take place, as it deals with external challenges that include the deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia and an upheaval in global trade ignited by President Donald J. Trump’s new tariffs. But after months of political limbo, the ruling bythe Constitutional Courton Friday finally gave South Korea a sense of direction that it has desperately needed. Mr. Yoon, who had defiantly held onto his job despite his impeachment, is a former president now. In the coming days, he must vacate his hilltop presidential residence in central Seoul, and the government will schedule a national election because his successor must be chosen within 60 days. On Friday, officials lowered a presidential emblem in front of a building from where Mr. Yoon used to run the government. Military units began removing his portraits. “This is a victory for South Korean democracy,” said Sung Deuk Hahm, dean of the Graduate School of Political Studies at Kyonggi University, remembering how South Koreans had sacrificed their lives to oppose military rule in the past. “It has taken time, but this time, the rule of law eventually prevailed without blood-shedding or serious violence.”Mr. Yoon’s institution of martial law,which lasted six hours until the National Assembly voted to kill it, was the first attempt by a South Korean leader to use the military as a political tool since the country began democratizing in the 1980s. South Korea’s impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol attends a hearing of his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court in Seoul in February. In a ruling millions of South Koreans, including schoolchildren, watched on live television on Friday, the Constitutional Court found Mr. Yoon guilty of “violating the constitutional order” and “betraying the people’s trust” when he sent troops to seize the legislature during his short-lived martial law. Hours before the ruling, supporters and opponents of Mr. Yoon gathered for rival rallies in Seoul, some camping out on the pavement overnight. As Acting Chief Justice Moon Hyungbae began reading out the 22-minute-long decision, silence fell as the crowds listened intently to every word of the ruling that would determine Mr. Yoon’s fate — and the future of South Korea’s democracy. Some clasped their hands together in prayer. When the verdict came, a crowd gathered near the court erupted. Those supporting Mr. Yoon’s removal reacted with screams of delight, pumping their fists into the air and hugging each other. “This is the day I’ve been waiting for over the past four months of protesting,” said Jang Jaeeuk, 21, who said he had stayed out on the street near the court overnight along with other students from his university, getting only three hours of sleep. At a rally of supporters of Mr. Yoon, there was loud booing. Some people folded over in dismay, and others loudly cursed. Ye Chung-ho, 65, had come to Seoul from Geoje Island, off the south coast of South Korea, spending two nights on the street to support Mr. Yoon. “The constitution has collapsed,” he said after the ruling. “The decision is illegal.”But the crowds dispersed quickly after the court’s announcement despite earlier fears of violent clashes. The police had been on their highest alert, erecting tall barricades around the courthouse. Schools in the neighborhood were closed. Businesses told employees to work from home. Hundreds of protesters demanding Mr. Yoon’s removal camped outside the Constitutional Court the night before the ruling. “Today marks the beginning of a true South Korea,” saidLee Jae-myung, the main opposition leader, who campaigned for Mr. Yoon’s removal. Mr. Lee is expected to win the nomination of the Democratic Party, and polls have shown that he had the strongest chance to win if a presidential election were held now. No strong front-runner has emerged in Mr. Yoon’s party. Mr. Yoon thanked his supporters and apologized to the people. But he did not comment directly on the court’s ruling, only saying: “I am regretful and sorry that I could not live up to your expectations.”But his People Power Party said it “humbly” accepted the ruling. Political turmoil could continue if Mr. Yoon’s hard-line supporters continue their protests. But “it won’t pose a big threat, as the People Power Party must shift its gears toward the new election,” said Ahn Byong-jin, a professor of political science at Kyung Hee University in Seoul. Mr. Yoon plunged his country into its biggest political crisis in decades when he suddenly declared martial law on Dec. 3 at a time when many world leaders were busy preparing for Mr. Trump’s return to the White House. Instead of building bipartisan cooperation, he attempted to seize the National Assembly with troops, labeling the opposition “anti-state forces.” Citizens quickly mobilized to block the military takeover, giving lawmakers time to gather and vote down his martial law declaration. Mr. Yoon ended up getting impeached, leaving his country to face Mr. Trump — and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un — under an acting president with no popular mandate. Police increased security near the Constitutional Court ahead of the announcement of the ruling. “South Korea has managed to avoid the worst outcomes and can see light at the end of a long political crisis,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said about Friday’s ruling. “And not a moment too soon, given how the next administration in Seoul must navigate North Korea’s military threats, China’s diplomatic pressure and Trump’s trade tariffs.”Mr. Yoon’s ouster was a crushing blow to the country’s conservative camp: He was the second conservative president in a row to be ousted by impeachment. (The first was President Park Geun-hye in 2017.) It increased the chances of his progressive foes in the current opposition to regain power and reshape South Korea’s foreign policy. Mr. Yoon pleased conservatives by adopting tough stances toward North Korea and China and expanding joint military drills with the United States. He alsowon plaudits from Washingtonwhen he improved ties with Japan to lay the ground for trilateral cooperation to deter China. His progressive rivals favor dialogue with North Korea and seek to be on good terms with both the United States, South Korea’s main military ally, and China, its biggest trade partner. “It will be an uphill battle for the conservative party to win a snap presidential election,” said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based fellow with the Center for a New American Security. “If Lee wins, South Korea’s foreign policy will likely look very different from what the U.S. and like-minded countries have enjoyed during Yoon’s presidency, because of the demands of the progressive base.”Mr. Yoon’s martial law also exposed how dangerously close the country could come to a military takeover. South Korea is grappling with a deepening political polarization, online demagoguery and the mainstreaming of a radical right wing. Its legislature is gridlocked by partisan warfare. “Whoever wins the next election will face the daunting challenges of bringing together a deeply fractured society, as well as dealing with Trump’s tariffs,” said Mr. Hahm. Protesters opposed to Mr. Yoon celebrating in downtown Seoul after the Constitutional Court delivered its ruling.

India Passes Contentious Bill Increasing Oversight of Muslim Land Trusts,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/asia/india-bill-muslim-land-waqfs.html,2025-04-04T10:36:00Z,World,The legislation passed by Parliament on Friday would allow non-Muslims to help administer so-called Waqfs.

Reporting from New DelhiIndia Passes Contentious Bill Increasing Oversight of Muslim Land TrustsThe legislation passed by Parliament on Friday would allow non-Muslims to help administer so-called Waqfs. The move fueled concerns that the rights of Muslims are being infringed on. The Indian Parliament passed a controversial bill on Friday that increases government oversight of properties held by Muslim trusts, despite vocal protests that the religious minority was being singled out for interference. The bill would allow the appointment of non-Muslims to panels administering the trusts, called Waqf boards, and empower state officials to be adjudicators of disputes. The Waqfs — whose legal foundation in India is over 100 years old — are one of the largest landowners in the country, managing more than 800,000 properties covering nearly a million acres, according to government figures. A 2006 report commissioned by the government estimated the value of the properties — which include mosques, religious seminaries, graveyards and other land often donated by individuals — at over $14 billion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party has said the changes in how the trusts are run was needed to improve efficiency and accountability, and prevent abuse. Ahead of introducing the bill in Parliament for a vote, Kiren Rijiju, India’s minister for parliamentary and minority affairs, said the legislation was not an attack on Muslim rights but a necessary reform to protect Waqf assets from misuse. “This is about transparency, not interference,” Mr. Rijiju said. Unlike during Mr. Modi’s previous term, when he used an absolute majority to push legislation through Parliament with often heavy-handed swiftness, the Waqf bill underwent months of deliberation. It also saw two days of passionate but cordial debate that went well past midnight each day before the vote. The sparring — increasingly rare in the legislature, where fewer bills have come under deliberation and scrutiny in recent years — was a sign that Mr. Modi, who lost his majority in last summer’s election, now needs the help of allied parties to pass legislation. But it also showed that his well-entrenched Bharatiya Janata Party was able to get its way even with reduced power, and that his parliamentary allies only acted as a slight moderating factor. Faizan Mustafa, the vice chancellor of Chankaya National Law University, said that while the Parliament has the power to enact legislation on religious and charitable endowments, those laws could still face further tests in the courts. “If any provision of the Waqf bill is in contravention of fundamental rights, it may be challenged and possibly struck down in the courts,” he said. “There can be an argument that Muslim endowments are treated differently from Hindu endowments laws in some places,” he added. Many critics of the new Waqf bill agree that there was a need to improve the management of the trusts. But they also say they are concerned that the bill is the ruling Hindu nationalist party’s latest attempt to target the country’s largest religious minority. While the constitution protects the rights of religious groups to manage their own affairs, some observers say this bill provides a new legal basis for the authorities to target the Muslim community. In states where Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is in power, officials have been bulldozing Muslim properties after alleging encroachment, often ignoring court orders on due process, the critics say. Right-wing groups have laid claim to several mosques, arguing in court that they were once the site of Hindu worship — despite Indian laws that prevent changing the status of places of worship. Vigilantes have also attacked Muslim shrines, taking hammers to graves. Imran Pratapgarhi, a Muslim member of Parliament from the opposition Indian National Congress, said he did not believe B.J.P. assertions that the bill was meant to benefit the Muslim community. “I am requesting the government: At least do not snatch away our places of worship, do not run bulldozers over our homes, and let us be at peace in our graves,” Mr. Pratapgarhi said.

Vivian Yee reported from Cairo; Bilal Shbair from Deir al-Balah, Gaza; and Adam Rasgon from Jerusalem. Risking Reprisals, Protesters in Gaza Call on Hamas to Step AsideDemanding an end to the war, hundreds pressed the militants to relinquish control of the enclave, a rare demonstration against a group that has suppressed dissent with violence. In a rare and perilous public show of anger against Hamas, hundreds of Palestinians marched through Beit Lahia in northern Gaza this week, demanding that the militant group relinquish control of the territory and end the war with Israel, according to four witnesses. The march on Wednesday appeared to be the latest of a handful of such protests that have broken out in the last two weeks, despite Hamas’s efforts to suppress dissent with threats and shows of force. Witnesses said it was the first of the protests in Beit Lahia that women joined, some bringing their children. Taken together, thedemonstrations, while small and scattered, represent the most serious challenge to Hamas’s iron-fisted 18-year rule of the Gaza Strip since the war began when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. The overwhelming Israeli response that followed has ripped apart the territory andresidents’ lives, killing tens of thousands. The bloodshed resumed after Israelended a two-month-old cease-fire agreementin mid-March, citing Hamas’s refusal to accept Israeli demands. Palestinians began marching about a week later in Beit Lahia, a farming community in the northernmost part of Gaza, and then in other parts of the enclave. The protests lasted for three days before appearing to fade. Activists posted on social media this week calling for new rallies. Demonstrators assembled in Beit Lahia’s main square and marched toward another square, protesters said in interviews. They gave varying estimates of the rally’s size, from about 1,000 to 1,500. “We have lost our homes, our loved ones, our hope and our future. Enough is enough,” said Abeer al-Radeea, 34, a homemaker who said she went to Wednesday’s demonstration with her husband and children. “We call on Hamas to stop this and leave us. We don’t know when this will end, but we want peace and democracy.”The march went forward despite widespread fear in Gaza of Hamas, which in the past has cracked down violently on challenges to its rule. After the recent protests, however, Hamas’s response has appeared more muted, reflecting what analysts said was both the group’s fear of further inflaming analready angry populationand its diminished ability to mobilize forces, with thousands of its members killed and with Israeli drones and warplanes overhead. But the threat of retribution by Hamas remains. The rally in Beit Lahia. The recent demonstrations, though small, represent the most serious challenge to Hamas’s rule of the Gaza Strip since the war began. On Friday, one of the protesters, Oday al-Rabi, 22, was abducted overnight by Hamas operatives from a shelter for displaced people in Gaza City, according to his brother, Hassan. Hassan, 32, said he received a call hours later to pick up his brother from Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City. He said Oday was bruised, bloodied and barely able to walk or talk. “My whole brother’s body was blood,” he said, adding that the Hamas operatives were dragging him with a leash. “It was as if I didn’t know him.”The operatives said that anyone who “curses” Hamas’s military wing would meet the same fate, Hassan said. He took his brother to another nearby hospital, but Oday died a few hours later. Hassan said he believed his brother had been targeted both because of his participation in protests and because of his history of criticizing Hamas. About a month ago, Oday was attacked by a group of Hamas members, but they ran away when he pulled a knife on them, Hassan said. Hamas officials and a spokesman for the Hamas-run government in Gaza did not respond to requests for comment. Protesters on Wednesday included Raed al-Masri, 44, who said that masked Hamas members had been stationed on some corners, holding truncheons and sticks. Two days after a previous protest, the Hamas-run internal security force in Gaza summoned Sharif al-Buheisi, 56, to a tent in the courtyard of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza. Mr. al-Buheisi is an activist in Fatah, Hamas’s rival political faction, and served as an administrator at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City before the war. Two officers delivered a threat, suggesting he would regret participating in future protests, Mr. al-Buheisi said in a phone interview. “This is not the time for protests — they’re stabbing the resistance in the back,” Mr. al-Buheisi recalled being told. “If you go out again, the result will not be good.”After consulting with his family, Mr. al-Buheisi said he decided to stay away from further protests. It was a bitter reminder, he said, of how civilians in Gaza were trapped. “We’re persecuted by both sides,” he said. “Israel bombs us without mercy and Hamas doesn’t care if we die.”Mr. al-Masri said that several of his cousins had also received Hamas threats after recent marches. One received a phone call from a private number summoning him to meet on Tuesday with Hamas security officials, who interrogated him about his involvement, asked about protest supporters and organizers, and forced him to sign a document saying he would stop protesting, Mr. al-Masri said. Others ignored such calls. At Wednesday’s protest, many demonstrators were driven to march by hunger, participants said. Israel hasblocked aidfrom entering Gaza for a month, forcingbakeries to close, markets to empty and aid groups to cut food distribution. Gaza residents say that what produce remains isexorbitantly expensive. One child at Wednesday’s demonstration yelled that he wanted something to eat, Ms. al-Radeea said. Another protester held up a piece of an onion, shouting that he had been eating only onions and radishes for more than a week, said Basem Hamouda, 47, a farmer who was there. For their desperation, the protesters blamed Israel — but also Hamas. “Those who cannot provide their people with a loaf of bread have no right to start a war in the name of liberation,” Mr. Hamouda said. He and others said Hamas should do a better job of holding down food prices by stopping merchants from hoarding supplies, a common complaint in Gaza. “Hamas has given Israel a pretext to continue this war while failing to regulate and control market prices,” he added. “That is the real cause behind these protests.”Ameera Haroudacontributed reporting from Doha, Qatar.

Stephen Castle visited Small Heath, Birmingham, joined a resident driving to a garbage and recycling facility and spoke with striking workers. Welcome to Birmingham, England — Mind the RatsA standoff between garbage collectors and municipal officials in Britain’s second largest city has left an estimated 17,000 tons of trash on the streets. A pungent smell of rotting garbage fills the air. Bulging sacks of trash pile high, some spilling their festering contents. And, with vermin plaguing parts of the city, at least one resident has claimed to have been bitten by a rat. With its heritage as a manufacturing powerhouse and its proud civic history, Birmingham likes to call itself Britain’s second city. Right now, it’s the nation’s garbage capital. A standoff between striking refuse workers and city officials has left an estimated 17,000 tons of trash piled on city streets that is attracting rats, foxes, cockroaches and maggots. On Monday, Birmingham’s municipality declared it a “major incident,” which allows it to access more resources from the government and other nearby regions. Some garbage collections are still taking place and the city has managed to keep many areas, including the center, clear of trash. But in several residential districts and parks it was highly conspicuous on Wednesday. In Small Heath, a neighborhood two miles from the city center, black plastic bags had piled up at the end of some streets, and people from other areas had added to the mess by dumping their uncollected garbage. “I have lived in England for 36 years. I have never seen a situation like this before,” said Javad Javadi, 51, a delivery driver who is originally from Iran, as he walked past overflowing plastic trash bins that lined Malmesbury Road. “Of course, at night time, if you come after 10 o’clock you see many rats,” he said. “So many that the cats don’t chase them.”Residents brought their trash to refuse lorries in Alum Rock, on Wednesday. Birmingham’s garbage pileup has caused a political stink in Britain’s Parliament where Jim McMahon, a minister from the governing Labour Party, warned of public health risks, and one Birmingham lawmaker, Preet Kaur Gill, said a constituent had written to say “that they had been bitten by a rat.”An opposition lawmaker, Julian Lewis, compared the situation to an infamous 1978 garbage collection strike during industrial unrest under the Labour government of James Callaghan. The period became known as the “winter of discontent,” and the following year Labour lost a general election, ushering Margaret Thatcher into power. This dispute, however, is confined to Birmingham, where more than 350 workers began limited walkouts in January that last month escalated into an indefinite full-scale strike. “We cannot tolerate a situation that is causing harm and distress to communities,” Birmingham City Council leader, John Cotton, said in astatement. Trade union members claim that a restructuring plan pushed by the municipalitywould leave around 150 workersup to £8,000 (about $10,400) a year poorer. The council disputes this, saying that “the number of staff that could lose the maximum amount (just over £6,000) is 17 people.”While the two sides remain deadlocked, the results were evident in Malmesbury Road where black plastic bags were heaped at both ends of the street and in an alleyway halfway down. Some despairing residents had begun taking their trash to the dump. As he loaded around 20 sacks into his car, Shakeel Ahmed explained that garbage had accumulated for three weeks outside his home and in his garden shed. Shakeel Ahmed’s car loaded with trash to take to the dump in Birmingham on Wednesday. “If I get angry it is not going to solve the problem,” he said, philosophically. Driving to a waste facility, Mr. Ahmed, 69, a retired train manager, kept the windows open and apologized for the smell in his car, adding that he would have it professionally cleaned after depositing the trash. “If I get angry it is not going to solve the problem,” he said, philosophically. At the refuse and recycling center in Tyseley, a few miles southeast of the city center, others had a similar story about the stench, the vermin and the damage to the city’s reputation. “We can’t open the window because of the smell, it’s rubbish everywhere — it’s ridiculous,” said Rubina Yaqoob, 43, describing the situation in Stechford, in east Birmingham. Her vehicle is new and she had lined its trunk with a sheet before loading it with 10 bags of trash. “Look at my car!” she said, pointing to the mess the garbage had made. Some don’t have this option, including Robert Shaw, 60, a school cleaner, who has found himself living next to a mounting pile of refuse bags at Henshaw Road. “What the council said to us is that we can take it to Tyseley,” he said. “But if you haven’t got a car, how are you supposed to take it?”Striking workers blocked refuse lorries from crossing the picket line at a depot in Tyseley in Birmingham on Wednesday. The crisis has forced some city dwellers to be inventive. Sitting in the sunshine in Morris Park, waiting to collect her three children from school, Tasnima Tafader recounted how her husband had called relatives to find space in their bins for some of the family’s garbage. His mother came through. Then, when a refuse truck arrived around 7:30 a.m. one morning, residents came out of their homes to load bags from the street into the truck, said Ms. Tafader, 34, an interpreter. At another depot in Tyseley, strikers gathered at the gates in front of departing refuse trucks, delaying their journeys by walking in front of them at a snail’s pace for several hundred yards. Lee Haven, a member of the Unite trade union, disputed the city’s claim that no worker “need lose any money,” arguing that planned changes could cost some £600 a month at a time when household bills are rising sharply. The origins of the dispute lie in 2023 when Birmingham City Councildeclared itself essentially bankrupt, partly as a result of equal pay cases brought by workers, and began to implement far-reachingcuts to servicesAs part of a restructuring plan, the municipality now wants to scrap one position on refuse teams, known as the waste recycling and collection officer, which it says does not exist in other municipalities. Workers in that role can take voluntary redundancy or move to another position. It says that simplifying the pay structure is crucial and keeping the role would risk “creating a huge future equal pay liability,” but declined requests to explain exactly why. “There is a feeling we are being made a scapegoat,” Mr. Haven said, as around 10 police officers looked on. “I think the normal working class family in this country will understand that nobody can afford to take that £600 loss.”Even as they bemoan the state of their streets, some city dwellers sympathize with the refuse collectors. “I don’t blame them because I don’t think their wages should be cut,” said Zeenat Hussain, 53, a health service administrator from Saltley. “What they are doing is an essential job.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

"Cockles, Mussels and Bodyguards: Dublin Acts to Protect Molly Malone Statue",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/dublin-molly-malone-statue.html,2025-04-04T09:02:02Z,World,"The city said it would provide stewards for its statue of the folk song figure — and repair its bust, which has been damaged by excessive touching.",Sculpture; Monuments and Memorials (Structures); Vandalism; Restoration and Renovation; Folk Music; City Councils,Molly Malone,Dublin (Ireland); Ireland,,"Posing for photos with the statue of Molly Malone last month during the St. Patrick’s Day parade in Dublin. Reporting from LondonCockles, Mussels and Bodyguards: Dublin Acts to Protect Molly Malone StatueThe city said it would provide stewards for its statue of the folk song figure — and repair its bust, which has been damaged by excessive touching. In song, and then in bronze, she has become an emblem of Irish culture and an enduring symbol of working-class Dublin. But to the familiar folklore of Molly Malone represented in her statue on Suffolk Street in central Dublin — a pretty young face, a hawker’s cart of cockles and mussels, a low-cut frilly dress — a new element will soon be added: wardens, provided by Dublin City Council. The life-size statue was erected to commemorate the central figure of “Molly Malone” or “Cockles and Mussels,” a song belted out during St. Patrick’s Day celebrations around the world. The City Council said on Thursday that it was responding to complaints about people, especially tourists, touching the statue. More specifically, the problem is with visitors grabbing and rubbing the statue’s breasts, supposedly for luck — something they do so often that its bust has become discolored. The stewards will be positioned next to the statue for a week in May, and will not only guard it, but also try to educate tourists about it, the council said in a statement. The city will also repair the damage to the statue’s bust, a process that it has had to repeat over the years. It is responding in part to a “Leave Molly mAlone” campaign led by Tilly Cripwell, 23, a final-year student at Trinity College Dublin who is also a regular busker on Suffolk Street. On Thursday, she welcomed the restoration work as a step toward rectifying the “physical and symbolic damage,” but was less impressed by the idea of wardens. “The stewarding system feels like a figurative barrier, which defeats the point, and the point is mind-set reform around behavior toward the statue,” she said. People coming to see Molly Malone help make Suffolk Street a lucrative busking spot. Singing there, Ms. Cripwell said, she could collect at least 60 euros an hour, about $66. But she grew ever more infuriated at seeing tourists and nighttime drinkers grope the statue. While touching parts of statues for luck is a widespread tradition — thetoes of St. Peter in the Vatican, the groin of the19th-century journalist Victor Noir in Paris’s Père Lachaise cemetery, even the testicles ofWall Street’s “Charging Bull”— the treatment of one of Dublin’s few statues of women struck Ms. Cripwell as both crude and sexist. “I just got more and more triggered by it, and one day I just thought if I want to keep on busking by the statue, I’m going to have to do something about this,” she said. To protest, Ms. Cripwell has used an alternative version of the popular folk song. “If she was there beside you, if she was alive oh,” shesang during one of her demonstrations, which have been joined by other performers. “Crying, ‘Stop, that’s enough’ — so leave Molly alone.”In the song, which has been mournfully covered byJoni MitchellandSinead O’Connor, Molly Malone is a tragic figure, a fishmonger who sells her wares on Dublin’s streets and eventually dies of a fever. People have long debated whether the song is based on a real person. The statue, commissioned in 1988 as part of celebrations of Dublin’s 1,000th anniversary, solidifies one particular version of the story, according toresearch by Sean Murphy, a city historian. The authorities planning the celebration suggested that they had identified the real Molly, pointing to the baptism and burial records of a woman named Mary Mallone, who was christened in 1663 and buried in 1699 near the site chosen for the statue. Mr. Murphy regards that as far from sufficient proof: The name was a common one, he said, and documentary evidence of the song begins well over a century later. “Myself and others protested back in the 1980s about the statue but were ignored,” he said. The design of the statue, and the publicity surrounding it, may have encouraged undignified treatment, he added. He said the sculpture represented Molly Malone as “a prosperous trader who freelanced as a prostitute,” something that the historian calls “a gratuitous charge.”Ms. Cripwell is seeking to give the disputed history a new chapter. Her campaign has sought to have the statue placed on a raised plinth, as many of Dublin’s heroic statues of men are, although the city’s statement dismissed that option as “costly.”And in place of stewards explaining the statue, Ms. Cripwell says she would prefer a plaque. “People don’t know the story — whether it’s fictional, whether it’s real, they don’t know it,” she said.

When Left Is Too Left in a Canada Rattled by Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/americas/canada-new-democratic-party-jagmeet-singh.html,2025-04-04T09:00:49Z,World,"As Canada faces an election defined by President Trump’s threats, its progressive party, the New Democrats, finds itself losing support and confronting an existential crisis.",Elections; Politics and Government; United States International Relations,"Poilievre, Pierre; Singh, Jagmeet; Trump, Donald J",United States; Canada,Conservative Party (Canada); Liberal Party (Canada); New Democratic Party (Canada),"Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, speaking in Ontario. Several public opinion polls show support for the New Democrats in the single digits. Reporting from TorontoWhen Left Is Too Left in a Canada Rattled by TrumpAs Canada faces an election defined by President Trump’s threats, its progressive party, the New Democrats, finds itself losing support and confronting an existential crisis. The pain of having teeth pulled and gums prodded for denture fittings was followed by relief at the payment counter: The $4,000 worth of work would cost Ron Brydges nothing under Canada’s new national dental care program. “This dental plan being free was just a godsend,” said Mr. Brydges, 84, a retired industrial mechanic in St. Catharines, Ontario. For that, Canadians largely have the leftist New Democratic Party to thank. Subsidized dental care is among several social programs, including a national drug plan and protections for striking workers, promoted in recent years by the New Democrats that have augmented Canada’s reputation on the global stage as a liberal bastion. “I view all these things as investments in people, not expenses,” said Mr. Brydges, a New Democrat supporter. “It makes us a better country.”But today the New Democrats are being severely tested, with questions swirling about the party’s very existence as Canada heads for national elections on April 28 amid a rupture with the United States, its neighbor and closest ally. The resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Trump’s economic assault on Canada have set off a tectonic political shift, leaving the New Democrats, and their leader, Jagmeet Singh, with dwindling support. With the country set to choose a new prime minister, voters are weighing who is best suited to defend the country against the United States, and polls show that Mr. Singh is not a viable option, prompting many longtime party backers to switch allegiance at a moment of heightened stakes. New Democrats who defect will likely support Mark Carney of the Liberal Party, who is in a neck-and-neck race against Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party. Some Canadians fear the New Democratic Party’s waning influence could weaken the country’s core liberal pillars on issues from health care to immigration to climate change. But the New Democrats have also drawn criticism from Conservative politicians and others who say that tax hikes to finance social programs will set back Canada’s struggling economy. The New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas during a television appearance in 1968. He is considered the father of universal health care in Canada. Who are the New Democrats? The New Democratic Party has produced some of Canada’s most visionary political leaders, including Tommy Douglas, the father of universal health care, and has helped expand far-reaching welfare programs. “They provide a kind of moral compass,” said Susie Moloney, a Canadian horror fiction writer and lifelong New Democrats supporter. She still has not gotten used to the red Liberal campaign button pinned to her coat, but believes that Mr. Carney, a former central banker, is the right person to take on Mr. Trump and steer Canada through economic turbulence. In a political lineup, Mr. Singh, who became the New Democrats’ leader in 2017, stands out, wearing a turban on his head and tucking a kirpan, or ceremonial knife, into his suit, reflecting his Sikh faith. He has been candid about his personal history, revealing in his memoir having been sexually abused by a taekwondo coach. He worked as a criminal lawyer before entering politics. Mr. Singh, 46, was viewed as the most likable candidate in the last national election, in 2021, with a particular knack for connecting with younger voters, drawing comparisons to liberal American politicians like Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Like all New Democrats that just love him, I think that he’s a very warm and dignified leader,” Ms. Moloney said. “He would be very electable in good times, but we’re in bad times right now.”After Mr. Trudeau was re-elected in 2021, the Liberals did not have a majority of parliamentary seats. Eventually, Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Singh forged an agreement combining seats to be able to push through legislation important to both parties. The New Democratsended the pactlast September, a turning point for Mr. Trudeau, leading ultimately to his resignation. The New Democrats are in danger of losing enough parliamentary seats to be disqualified as a national party. Where does the party stand? Several public opinionpollsshow support for the New Democrats in the single digits and some projections suggest its parliamentary representation could slide from 24 seats to below 12, which would disqualify the New Democrats as an official national party. But polls do not tell the full story, said Kim Wright, a longtime New Democrats strategist. “The top-line polling don’t really reflect what ends up happening on the ground come Election Day,” Ms. Wright said, highlighting recent examples in provincial elections where the party outperformed expectations. “We often see this as New Democrats and it doesn’t bother us.”On the campaign trail, the party can point to a slew of social programs and laws it helped advance. The national dental plan the party helped establish enrolls 3.5 million Canadians, with New Democrats calling it the “largest expansion of free Canadian health care in generations.”Under Mr. Singh, the New Democrats also pushed forward a law banning the use of replacement employees when federally-regulated workplaces go on strike, and helped introduce a drug plan that makes certain medications free. But because all this was achieved in partnership with Mr. Trudeau’s government, the Liberals can also take the credit. The distinction is hard to explain to voters, said David McGrane, a political studies professor at the University of Saskatchewan. “There’s the old adage in politics,” he said. “When you’re explaining, you’re losing.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Kim Barker reported from Kyiv, Ukraine; Sanjana Varghese from London; and Yurii Shyvala from Lviv, Ukraine. Russia Executes P.O.W.s Without Caring Who Watches, Ukraine SaysLive drone footage allows Ukraine to observe what it views as war crimes unfold in real time, soldiers say. On a Monday morning last fall, Ukrainian drone pilots watched what had become a familiar scene unfold on a drone’s live feed: Russian soldiers pointed their guns at two Ukrainians, who seemingly surrendered. Then, the footage showed, the Russians shot them point blank. The video, provided by a pilot who said he had witnessed the killing on the feed, was verified by The New York Times and the Centre for Information Resilience, a nonprofit organization. It appeared to show the Ukrainian prisoners executed near the village of Novoivanovka in the Kursk region of Russia. “There were no polite words spoken among us — we were filled with rage and an intense desire for revenge,” said the pilot, 26, who served with the 15th Mobile Border Guard and asked to be identified by his call sign of “One Two” in accordance with military protocol. As the United States embraces Russian talking points in its push for a cease-fire in Ukraine, many Ukrainians wonder whether allegations of Russian war crimes will simply be forgotten. President Trump has indicated that he would like to re-establish ties with Russia and end the war — or at least, wind down the U.S. commitment to Ukraine made under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The U.S. informed European officialsrecently that it is withdrawing from a multinational group created to investigate allegations of war crimes against senior Russian leaders and allies responsible for launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Biden administration joined the group in 2023. The U.S. State Department has alsoended fundingfor thetracking of tens of thousandsof Ukrainian childrenabducted by Russia. While bothsideshave been accused of committing war crimes,Russiahas faced far more allegations, not only from Ukraine but also human-rights groups and the United Nations. In recent months, Ukrainian and international human-rights officials have accused Russian troops of executing Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered instead of taking them as prisoners of war, as required under the Geneva Conventions treaties that outline how nations should treat enemy forces and civilians during armed conflict. A recent U.N. report decried an “alarming spike” in Russian executions of Ukrainian prisoners. In December, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman office announced that177Ukrainian prisoners of war had been executed on the battlefield since the beginning of the war; of those, 109 were killed in 2024 alone. Russians have killed at least 25 additional Ukrainian soldiers since then, according to Artem Starosiek, who runs Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that supports the war effort and analyzed videos to come up with that tally. The Times could not independently verify that count. “This could be one of the largest campaigns of intentional P.O.W. murder in modern history,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha,saidin February. The Russian Defense Ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the Ukrainian allegations, although the Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia commits war crimes in Ukraine. Five Ukrainian drone pilots said in interviews that they had watched as drone videos showed their fellow soldiers surrendering, only to be killed. On Telegram, such videos have become commonplace. Although Russian officials have denied committing war crimes in Ukraine, some Russian soldiers appear so unconcerned about potential repercussions that they have posted their own videos of killing unarmed Ukrainians. In past conflicts, war crimes usually happened out of sight, only to be revealed later through investigations. But drones mean that these executions can be tracked in real time: Grainy footage showed as many as 16 men, lined up and shot deadSept. 30, after surrendering near the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. Nine Ukrainian drone operators were forced to strip to their underwear and lie face down on the ground in Kursk before beingshot Oct. 10— the footage was so clear, a mother of one man later recognized him. Some perpetrators film the videos themselves — like one posted in January that circulated widely on social media and appeared to show the executions ofsix Ukrainian soldiersnear Donetsk, the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said. “One’s mine,” one Russian said on the video. “Film me on camera, damn it,” another added. The video ended with a seventh Ukrainian on the ground, his fate unclear. Although the video’s location couldn’t be independently verified, the men killed in the video wore yellow armbands, like Ukrainian forces are known to. One soldier involved was identified byopen source researchers, and laterThe Financial Times, as a Russian named Oleg Yakovlev. Since the end of August, the U.N. human-rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has documented 29 encounters in which Russian soldiers killed at least 91 incapacitated Ukrainian soldiers, including the episode witnessed by One Two. Human-rights monitors analyzed videos and photos published by Ukrainian and Russian sources showing executions and dead bodies, interviewed witnesses and verified that the reported executions took place near Russian offensives, said Danielle Bell, the head of the mission. “It’s horrible,” Ms. Bell said in an interview. “And these are just the cases that we have assessed as being credible and reliable.”During those same six months, the United Nations documented one execution of an incapacitated Russian soldier by Ukrainian troops, Ms. Bell said. She would not speculate on why the number of killings has increased. But in August, Ukrainian soldiers invaded Kursk, potentially sparking retaliation. Some military analysts said the Russians could be trying to intimidate potential Ukrainian recruits from joining the army and make Russian soldiers think twice before surrendering — because the Ukrainians might want revenge. Russian soldiers captured after executing Ukrainian troops said in interrogations that they were ordered to kill them — even after telling commanders that the Ukrainians had surrendered and tossed their weapons on the ground, according to an edited video of the interrogations released recently by the Ukrainian Special Forces. The Ukrainians apparently began to run “after hearing the command over the radio to open fire,” one captured Russian said in the video. He added: “And fire was opened on them.”In mid-March, as Russian forces sought to retake Kursk, a photo circulated of several Ukrainian prisoners of war with their hands behind their backs. Another video, which could not be independently verified, showed the same prisoners, now dead, with three of them bleeding from the backs of their heads. The person filming used slurs to refer to them as he counted the corpses for the camera. The orders are likely to come from the top, analysts said. The deputy head of Russia’s Security Council — Dmitri Medvedev, the former president — said that Ukrainian soldiers had no right to life or mercy after Ukraine’sAzov Brigadeposted a video of a soldier shooting what appeared to be an injured Russian soldier on social media in July. “Execute, execute and execute,” Mr. Medvedev wrote onTelegramIn October, the Washington-based Institute for theStudy of Warsaid: “Russian commanders are likely writ large condoning, encouraging, or directly ordering the execution of Ukrainian P.O.W.s.”When drone pilots have seen the Russians pointing their weapons at the Ukrainians on video, the pilots said, they often went quiet watching their comrades get shot. Then they swore. One commander said one scene still haunted him: A Russian soldier shot four Ukrainian soldiers lying face down in a trench near Chasiv Yar, and he could do nothing to stop it. “Without hesitation, he executed them all,” said the commander, who uses the call sign “Madara,” for a Japanese manga hero. In another video, Russians surrounded four injured Ukrainians, forced them out of their shelter into a yard and confiscated their weapons. The Russians then took three of the soldiers to the street and shot them, said one military intelligence officer from the 110th Brigade with the call sign of “Grandfather.” It was one of three executions of Ukrainian soldiers in the Donetsk region he had watched on video feeds from drones at a command post over the past year. “The worst part was the helplessness — we couldn’t do anything to help our men,” Grandfather said. After seeing the Ukrainian soldiers killed on the morning of Nov. 11, One Two said commanders wanted the drone pilots to retaliate. The pilots of three units met on a video call. One Ukrainian drone tracked five Russians — the two who shot the Ukrainians, and the three who stood by — and gave a live feed of their movements into the forest. Ten other drones followed, surrounding the five Russians. And then, One Two said, the drone pilots fired their weapons and killed them.

"When Kenyan Maids Sought Help Overseas, Diplomats Demanded Sex",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/africa/kenya-saudi-arabia-maids-abuse.html,2025-04-04T09:00:08Z,World,Women say that embassy officials added a new level of indignity to the abuse they suffered while working abroad.,Foreign Workers; Labor and Jobs,"Ruto, William",Saudi Arabia; Kenya; Nairobi (Kenya); Africa; Riyadh (Saudi Arabia),,"Faith Gathuo. Reporting from Nairobi and many towns around Kenya. When Kenyan Maids Sought Help Overseas, Diplomats Demanded SexWomen say that embassy officials added a new level of indignity to the abuse they suffered while working abroad. Selestine Kemoli fled to the Kenyan Embassy in Riyadh in 2020, terrified and desperate. Ms. Kemoli had been working in Saudi Arabia as a maid. Like many East Africans in her situation, she said, she was being abused. She told the embassy’s labor attaché that her boss slashed her breasts with a paring knife, forced her to drink urine and raped her. Broke and alone, she wanted help getting home to her two children in Kenya. “You are beautiful,” the labor attaché, Robinson Juma Twanga, responded, according to Ms. Kemoli. Mr. Twanga offered to help, she said, but with a catch. “I will sleep with you, just the same way your boss has slept with you,” she remembers him saying. Multiple women, who did not know each other and lived in separate counties, told The New York Times that when they fled abuse in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Twanga demanded sex or money, or pressured them to go into sex work to pay for a ticket home. Robinson Juma Twanga, the Kenyan labor attaché, during a conversation about protecting overseas workers in 2021. Lawyers say they have collected similar accounts from numerous women involving other embassy officials. They said that Mr. Twanga is but one example of how these officials exploit women at their most vulnerable moments. A spokesman for William Ruto, Kenya’s president, commenting on behalf of the Foreign Ministry, said he had no knowledge of such complaints or any mistreatment by embassy officials. Reached by phone and told what the women had said about him, Mr. Twanga replied: “I cannot get involved in that kind of story.” He said he is retired. The women, who were interviewed across Kenya, gave consistent accounts. They said Kenyan officials insulted them and questioned whether they needed help, even when they arrived at the embassy destitute and with visible signs of abuse. Ms. Kemoli, for instance, still has a scar across her chest and arms. “They didn’t care for us,” said Faith Gathuo. She left for Saudi Arabia in 2014 and said that, when she sought help after being beaten and raped, another embassy official demanded money and anal sex. Read our Earlier InvestigationTens of thousands of Kenyans go each year to Saudi Arabia, where they can earn more than in their home country, which is ina prolonged economic crisis. Hundreds have died. Many more have endured abuse, gone unpaid or wound up detained in a country that lacks effective legal protection for East African workers. A Times investigation last monthrevealedthat powerful East African and Saudi figures make money off the labor system that sends these workers abroad. When things go wrong, these latest interviews show, other powerful officials seek to profit. Multiple women identified Mr. Twanga. Ms. Kemoli said he asked for sex. Two others said that when they asked for help, he berated them and told them to return to their employers. A fourth woman, Feith Shimila Murunga, said that her boss beat her and poured hot water on her as punishment. When she sought the embassy’s help, she said, Mr. Twanga told her that if she didn’t want to return to her employer, maybe she could become a prostitute. Feith Shimila Murunga. Lawyers in Nairobi provided the written accounts of six other women who said Mr. Twanga refused to help or told them to go into sex work. “There’s no one holding them accountable,” said Bonareri Okeiga, who until recently was a program coordinator at Global Justice Group, a legal aid organization that has helped women document their experiences in hopes of getting them compensation. While Mr. Twanga’s name surfaced repeatedly, workers and their families also described difficult experiences with other officials. The relatives of three workers who died in Saudi Arabia said that officials at Kenya’s Foreign Ministry solicited cash to bring the bodies home. Hussein Mohamed, the president’s spokesman, said families were sometimes asked “to chip in” because the ministry cannot afford to pay for all of the bodies. But relatives who returned to the ministry with lawyers said that they were told that they did not actually need to pay. Years after returning from Saudi Arabia, Ms. Gathuo still has a gap in her smile from when, she said, her boss smashed her face with a pressure cooker. After he raped and impregnated her, she said, she escaped. An embassy official offered to help, she said, if she paid him and had anal sex with him. She agreed, she said, and gave him all she had — about $500. But he never sent her home. Eventually, Saudi Arabia deported her. Mr. Mohamed, the presidential spokesman, did not answer questions about Ms. Gathuo’s account. Ms. Kemoli, who said her employer raped and cut her, said she refused Mr. Twanga’s proposition for sex. A well-connected relative in Kenya ultimately contacted the International Organization for Migration, which bought her a ticket home in 2021. Ms. Kemoli said she has never been fully paid for her work in Saudi Arabia. She said she suffers from insomnia and often breaks down sobbing, seemingly unprompted. She said she has attempted suicide. Sometimes, she said, her children ask about her scars. “I don’t know what to tell them,” she said.

"Who Is Yoon Suk Yeol, and What Comes Next for Him?",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/asia/skorea-yoon-next.html,2025-04-04T07:37:11Z,World,"South Korea’s former president still faces criminal charges of leading an insurrection when he declared martial law. If found guilty, he could be imprisoned for life.",Decisions and Verdicts; Politics and Government; Impeachment; Martial Law,Yoon Suk-yeol,South Korea,,"Supporters of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol waved a flag with his image after the Constitutional Court announced the verdict today in Seoul, upholding the impeachment. Who Is Yoon Suk Yeol, and What Comes Next for Him? South Korea’s former president still faces criminal charges of leading an insurrection when he declared martial law. If found guilty, he could be imprisoned for life. Yoon Suk Yeol’s political career may be over, but his troubles are not. Ex-President Yoon, a former prosecutor, was removed from office by the Constitutional Court on Friday. But he still faces criminal charges of leading an insurrection over his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. A separate trial on those charges began in February and is ongoing. Prosecutors say that Mr. Yooncommitted insurrectionwhen he banned all political activities and ordered military commanders to break the National Assembly’s doors down “with axes” or “by shooting, if necessary” and “drag out” lawmakers. Mr. Yoon has repeatedly rejected the claims of orchestrating an insurrection. He said that he declared martial law to protect the nation from “anti-state forces” who infiltrated the government. If the court finds Mr. Yoon guilty, he could face a long prison term. But many of South Korea’s former imprisoned presidents, including Park Geun-hye, who was convicted of bribery, have ended up being released early. Ms. Park was pardonedin 2021 by then-president Moon Jae-in, less than five years into her 20-year prison term. Protesters supporting Yoon Suk Yeol sat quietly near his residence after the Constitutional Court announced its decision to remove him from office. The criminal case will not be directly affected by the Constitutional Court ruling that upheld his impeachment. Mr. Yoon’s time in office was plagued with problems and scandals. After his narrow electoral win in 2022, he soon became a deeplyunpopular and divisiveleader. As president Mr. Yoon used lawsuits, state regulators and criminal investigations toclamp down on speechthat he called disinformation, efforts that were largely aimed at news organizations. The police and prosecutors repeatedly raided the homes and newsrooms of journalists whom his office accused of spreading “fake news.”Mr. Yoon was also accused of using his power to advance his own interests. He was accused of pressuring the Defense Ministry towhitewash an investigationinto the death of a South Korean marine in 2023, and vetoed a bill pushed through Parliament by the opposition calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the claim. Mr. Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, was also at the center of some of his troubles. In late 2023,spy cam footage emergedshowing Ms. Kim accepting a $2,200 Dior pouch as a gift. The episode roiled his political party and became a significant issue ahead of parliamentary elections. Relations with North Korea sankto longtime lowsafter Mr. Yoon took office. For decades, the two Koreas — which never signed a peace treaty after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce — have swung between conciliatory tones and saber rattling. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been unpredictable and bellicose, developing nuclear weapons and supplying Russia with munitions and troops for its war against Ukraine. Mr. Yoon adopted a confrontational approach and called for spreading the idea of freedom to the North to penetrate the information blackout there. He also expanded joint military drills with the United States and Japan. North Korea, under Mr. Kim, has veered toward a more hawkish stance, shutting off all dialogue with Seoul and Washington, doubling down ontesting nuclear-capable missiles, and vowing to treat South Koreanot as a partner for reunification but as an enemythat the North must annex should war break out. Mr. Yoon leaves behind a government without an elected leader and facing a presidential poll within 60 days. “It has been a great honor for me to work for the country,” Yoon Suk Yeol said in a statement released through his lawyers after he was removed from office. “I thank those who supported and cheered me despite my shortcomings. I am regretful and sorry that I could not live up to your expectations,” he said, without directly commenting on the Constitutional Court’s decision. Mr. Yoon and his wife will need to vacate the official residence where he once holed up to resist arrest, protected by barricades and scores of security guards. The couple is expected to move back into their private home in Seoul, where they had lived before Mr. Yoon’s election. But they will continue to have the protection of the presidential security services — one of the few benefits allowed for a former leader ousted through impeachment.

Reporting from Canberra, AustraliaFaced With a Changed Ally, Australia Debates the Need for a ‘Plan B’The country has doubled down on its defense relationship with the United States in recent years. President Trump’s treatment of allies is prompting some to question the wisdom of that path. Australia is one of America’s closest allies; the two countries havefought alongsideeach other in every major conflict since World War I. Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden’s national security adviser,saidin January that the two had effectively entered a “strategic marriage.”Lately, though, Australians have been feeling rather like a spouse who awoke one morning to find a complete stranger lying next to them. Many have watched, aghast, how President Trump has treated other longstanding allies such as Canada and Europe, cavalierly threatening their economies with hefty tariffs andcasting doubton the U.S. commitment to protect NATO members. Australia itself was hit this week with a 10 percent tariff on its exports to the United States, in addition to a 25 percent tariffs on its steel and aluminum. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursdaythe moves would “have consequences for how Australians see this relationship.”All this has Australians taking a hard look their own heavily intertwined and dependent military relationship with the United States — even as China is making its growing military mightfelt in the region— and asking if they are in need of a “Plan B.”“We are dealing with a very different America,” Malcolm Turnbull, a former conservative prime minister, said in an interview. “We’re dealing with an America whose values no longer align with ours.”As a nation of 27 million stretched over a geographical expanse that rivals the continental United States, Australia has always relied on a powerful partner for its defense — first Britain, then the United States. In recent years, Australia became an integral part of the U.S. military posture in the region to counter China’s increased assertiveness. U.S. Marines regularly rotate through northern Australia, U.S. submarines dock in its west, and the government signed a 2021deal with Washington and London, known as AUKUS, to equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines over the coming decades. From left, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, then-President Biden and Britain’s then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in San Diego, Calif., in 2023 for the AUKUS agreement. But now, some question whether the assumptions underlying those arrangements still hold, given Mr. Trump’s “America First” stance. Can Australia rely on the United States to come to its aid in a time of need, and can Australia continue to stand militarily by its American ally if it fundamentally disagrees with its view of the world? “We really have to revise our thinking about the United States as a country,” said John McCarthy, formerly Australia’s ambassador to the United States. Mr. Turnbull, whose tenure overlapped with part of Mr. Trump’s first term, convened a forum this week in the capital, Canberra, to discuss the U.S. alliance. He said he did so because he felt Australia’s political parties were not paying enough attention to the changes in and challenges to the alliance, focusing instead on domestic issues in the lead-up to next month’s federal election. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have said Australia needs to do more for its own defense. Mr. Albanese’s Labor government has announced plans to increase military spending to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product over the next decade, while the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, haspledged to investabout $1.9 billion in a squadron of fighter jets. At the center of Australia’s plans for long-term security is the AUKUS deal for nuclear-powered submarines, which washeraldedas an unprecedented partnership involving the sharing of sensitive American nuclear technology. Under the agreement, Australia will first acquire secondhand U.S. Virginia-class submarines, and eventually build its own, as a response to growing Chinese military influence in the Asia Pacific. Nuclear-fueled propulsion would allow them to stealthily cover vastly longer distances without having to surface. Since its signing, however, the agreement has faced questions in Australia about whether the United States could speed up its shipbuilding enough to hand over the used submarines on time, and whether it would automatically draw the country into conflicts involving the United States, such as over Taiwan. The volatility of the Trump administration and its relationships with allies has amplified the skepticism. “Donald Trump’s doing us a favor by making clear to us things we’ve been determined not to recognize for ourselves,” said Hugh White, an emeritus professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University and a former intelligence and defense official, who has been critical of the deal. But as much as Australians may feel the need for a more independent defense, the country’s politicians have not communicated to the public the resources that would need to be redirected, said Charles Edel, Australia chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Ultimately Australia may have too much to gain from the alliance and need it for the balance of power in the region, he said after the forum. Dennis Richardson, a former secretary of foreign affairs and defense who also served as Australia’s ambassador to Washington, said as much at Mr. Turnbull’s forum. “I don’t think we need to waste time on a Plan B,” he said, referring to the AUKUS deal. “The worst possible thing we could do at this point would be to change horses.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move. U.S.-Iran Talks: Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last,opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitionsand avoid war.

Reporting from SeoulSeoul Erupts With Emotion After Yoon Is Removed From OfficeStill, after four months of political uncertainty, many people expressed apprehension about what lies ahead for the country. For hours, the atmosphere in the streets surrounding South Korea’s Constitutional Court in downtown Seoul had been tense. Dozens had camped out overnight in the early spring chill in the lead-up to the court’s historical decision on Friday. The crowds for and against the dismissal of the country’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, were separated by police buses and metal barriers up to 13 feet in height. As the acting chief justice began reading out the decision, filled with technical legal jargon, the crowds grew quieter, straining to hear from outdoor loudspeakers the outcome that would determine Mr. Yoon’s fate — and that of the country. Some people opposed to Mr. Yoon cheered and applauded intermittently as the reading went on. Protesters on both sides clasped their hands together in prayer. Many held up their phones to record the moment. And then, the crowd erupted. Those supporting Mr. Yoon’s impeachment reacted with hugs, screams and fists pumped in the air to the unanimous decision to remove him from office. At a rally of supporters of Mr. Yoon near his residence, there was loud booing. Some people folded over in dismay, and others loudly cursed. Protesters celebrating in downtown Seoul. Two women are overcome with emotion after the ruling. “It’s been so hard, but now my heart is relieved,” said Kim Ji-seon, 55, who brought her daughter to witness the verdict in the hopes that Mr. Yoon’s impeachment would be upheld. “I hope they can create a country where people can be happy.”Soon after the decision was announced, only a handful of people, some wearing “Make Korea great again” and “stop the steal” hats, were left at a pro-Yoon demonstration that was scheduled to last all day outside the presidential office. Construction workers were taking down scaffolding, and dozens of chairs had been stacked and pushed to the side. Jang Jaeeuk, 21, said he had stayed out on the street near the court overnight along with other students from his university, getting only three hours of sleep, because it was such an important day for his country. “I’m happy that the hardships of the past four months haven’t gone to waste,” he said after crying and hugging his fellow students upon hearing the verdict. “Now I feel that we can change the world and, in that sense, I’m hopeful for the future.”Supporters of Mr. Yoon near the court, who were predominantly men, said that they were deeply disappointed that the president was removed and went home. Supporters of Mr. Yoon near his residence. People watching as the acting chief justice began reading out the decision. Yoon Seo-jun, 18, sitting on the edge of a sidewalk, said he was distrustful of the system that led to the impeachment and dismayed about the future of the country. “South Korea’s democracy is dead,” he said, adding that he hoped the National Assembly, which had impeached Mr. Yoon, would be dissolved. After the decision, some South Koreans expressed apprehension about what might come next and the possibility of further political upheaval. Lee Yongseok, 27, who watched the court’s televised decision at a screen at Seoul’s main railway station, said that although he supported the verdict, he knew that others would be skeptical of the ruling and of the judges who made it. “I feel like something big is going to come to my country,” he said. Even as supporters and opponents of Mr. Yoon tried to grasp what comes next for their country, government officials were taking steps to move on. In a gesture that underlined the finality of the court’s ruling, the officials removed the presidential emblem in front of the building where Mr. Yoon used to work as president.

What to Know About the Removal of South Korea’s PresidentThe country’s Constitutional Court on Friday upheld the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, dismissing him from office four months after his short-lived imposition of martial law. South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Friday upheld the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, removing him from office four months after his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. Protesters who have been demanding his ouster erupted in cheers at the ruling, waving flags and pumping their fists in the air. For weeks leading up to the ruling, hundreds of thousands of people protesting for and against Mr. Yoon have lined the streets of Seoul, often enduring freezing temperatures, rain and snow. At 11 a.m. local time, the court’s acting chief justice, Moon Hyungbae, began reading the ruling, which came after months of deliberation. Some 22 minutes later, he announced that all eight of the court’s justices had voted to remove Mr. Yoon from office. The now ex-president had “betrayed the trust of the people” and “severely violated the law,” Mr. Moon said. “It has been a great honor for me to work for the country,” Mr. Yoon said in a statement released through his lawyers. “I and regretful and sorry that I could not live up to your expectations.”The court ruling is effective immediately and cannot be appealed. Why was Mr. Yoon impeached? Late on Dec. 3, Mr. Yoon stunned the country when he declared martial law, but it lasted only six hours because lawmakers quickly voted to overturn it. Shortly after he made the announcement on live television, troops stormed the National Assembly building under orders to “break down the door and drag out” lawmakers gathering inside to vote down the martial law decree and arrest key figures, including the speaker of the floor. Crowds of citizens confronted the troops, and some lawmakers scaled fences to get into the assembly and vote. On the same night, Mr. Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission who attempted to search and confiscate its database. This violated the agency’s constitutionally guaranteed independence, the court ruled. Delivering the ruling, Justice Moon said Mr. Yoon had abused his duties as the nation’s commander in chief. The martial law decree did not meet the constitutional requirement for a national crisis which Mr. Yoon repeatedly said was one of the reasons he had made the extraordinary declaration. The judges said that Mr. Yoon rushed his idea for imposing martial law through a hurriedly convened Cabinet meeting on the night of Dec. 3. without proper deliberation, and that he failed to notify the National Assembly, as was required by law. Only six of the eight members on the bench needed to vote in favor to uphold the impeachment, but the decision was unanimous. What will happen next? Acting president Han Duck-soo will continue in his role until the nation elects a new president through a snap election. This must take place within 60 days from Friday, meaning early June at the latest. The National Election Commission is expected to announce the date in the coming days. Political parties will select their candidates through primary elections. Lee Jae-myungis the expected front-runner to lead the opposition Democratic Party.

They Fought to Save Lives in Myanmar. The Earthquake Claimed Theirs. Five friends defied the junta to care for people injured in the military coup. One returned from the battlefield to find his four friends among the dead in the March 28 earthquake. The five young doctors took up their mission together: defying Myanmar’s junta to treat the wounded through the coup and deadly military crackdown four years ago. Since then, each continued supporting the democratic cause. For Dr. Min, 32, that meant fleeing to the jungle to offer battlefield triage torebel forceswho were fighting the army. But when theearthquakelast week devastated his home city, Mandalay, he knew he had to cross combat zones to check on his family and help his friend group of doctors again. “I prayed the whole way back,” he said. Dr. Min returned in time to watch his four friends’ bodies being pulled from the rubble of a12-story condominium, the stench of mass death simmering in the tropical heat. It’s a measure of Myanmar’s collapse that the generals have come to see health care providers as enemies of the state. The junta has closed at least seven private hospitals in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, that were seen as sympathetic to the resistance. It has jailed doctors and nurses. Nevertheless, Dr. Min joined a group of medical volunteers and rushed to the stricken city. Residents were clawing through the debris with bare hands, spurred by the cries and then the whispers of the trapped. Eventually, the sounds ceased. One day, a mother and her 4-month old daughter were pulled out alive. Dr. Min administered first aid. The baby died. At the 12-story condo, there were only bodies, Dr. Min said, including the four friends who had joined him in defying the coup. The site in Mandalay where Dr. Min’s friends died. “It was heartbreaking to see them on stretchers, not breathing,” he said. Before the coup, Dr. Min, who is being identified by part of his name for his security, led a normal life. His girlfriend was a nurse. He drove a Honda hatchback and vacationed at a beach in Thailand. Influenced by his father, a math teacher who listened secretly to BBC radio during an earlier era of military rule, Dr. Min supported the democratic opposition, which won elections in 2015 and 2020. “I was really happy back then,” he said. In February 2021, the military jailed Myanmar’s elected leaders. Dr. Min joined peaceful protests that sent hundreds of thousands of people into the streets. The junta responded by unleashing snipers. The public hospital Dr. Min worked for refused to send ambulances to collect the casualties. So he joined a civil disobedience movement, which saw trash collectors, auditors and doctors alike boycotting the new military regime. Government medical workers at a Yangon hospital in 2021. They, like many doctors, joined a campaign to express opposition to the military coup that year. Dr. Min and his friends began treating civilians targeted by the junta. There were many single gunshot wounds, all to the head, some in children, he said. Once, Dr. Min helped an old woman into a private ambulance with flashing lights, only for soldiers to strafe the van with gunfire. After the protests, Dr. Min escaped to a jungle where professionals like him — lawyers, accountants, doctors — formed an armed struggle against the junta. He learned how to sleep with the noise of night insects and how to dig a latrine. The unit started with 80 soldiers. It has lost about 20 on the battlefield. When the earthquake struck, rebel groups had been advancing against the military, which has fortified the big cities, Mandalay included. Despite pleading for international assistance with the quake damage, the junta has siphoned off supplies to the capital, Naypyidaw, and set up roadblocks to prevent volunteers from entering towns and more remote areas. “The military junta is once again using a humanitarian crisis to assert its authority at the cost of thousands of lives,” said Charles Santiago, the co-chair of a Southeast Asian collective of lawmakers dedicated to human rights. There is little chance that anyone is still alive in the wreckage of Mandalay, although one man was rescued after five days. Disease now threatens. Unnerved by aftershocks and unable to return to their destroyed homes, residents are sleeping where they can, in the shadow of the city’s tiered palace or in open fields. The junta’s soldiers occasionally kick them out, forcing them to find new shelter. Food and water are running low. With people fearful of returning to buildings made unstable by the earthquake, many are camping out. A shelter in a makeshift tent camp in Amarapura township, Mandalay, on Thursday. “The junta cares more about shutting down hospitals and blocking doctors than saving lives after the earthquake,” Dr. Min said. “They are not acting like humans.”After watching more bodies emerge from the rubble, Dr. Min took a break. There were, he feared, no more lives to save. He passed buildings listing at strange angles. He avoided the growing piles of trash, walking down a familiar lane toward his family home. It was still standing. His family spilled out to greet him. Everyone was alive. He held them close, the strain of the last four years overwhelming him. They talked, although it was impossible to say everything or even much of anything. Then Dr. Min left home again.

Now, residents have returned, and they hope visitors will, too.",Volcanoes; Earthquakes; Travel and Vacations,,Santorini (Greece),,"A cruise ship arriving at Santorini, Greece, last month. Reporting from AthensAs Unexplained Quakes Ease, Santorini Insists It’s Open for BusinessThe Greek island was shaken by thousands of mostly smaller-scale temblors. Now, residents have returned, and they hope visitors will, too. Weeks after being rattled bythousands of mostly small-scale earthquakes, the island of Santorini, the jewel in the crown of Greece’s tourism sector, is determined to return to business as usual — even as the quake phenomenon remains a mystery. The tourism-dependent island, which had been enjoying a strong comeback after the coronavirus pandemic, is counting on it. The first two cruise ships of the season arrived on the last two Sundays of March, andmore than 40 are due this month, kicking off a year in which the union of cruise ship owners has predicted a 10 percent increase in cruise visitors over last year. But hoteliers are still expecting a slower year, with bookings down about 30 percent compared with 2024. “Things have woken up over the past couple of weeks,” said Alexis Yannoulatos, who runs the Blue Dolphins hotel and the Grand View on Santorini’s caldera, the rim of an ancient volcano that gave the island its unique shape, multicolored beaches and rock formations. But he said that April was likely to be a “miserable” month for tourism revenues. Mr. Yannoulatos, who hosted visitors from South Korea at the height of the quake crisis in mid-February, said that occupancy at his hotels was 30 percent for April, with reservations for May and the summer months expected to rise to about 50 percent. Tourists gathering to watch the sunset in a Santorini village last month. Maria Manousoudaki, who owns the cliff-side Alti Suites in the island’s southwest, said that bookings were “coming in dribs and drabs” for the next couple of months, but that she would be opening half full this week, with visitors from Britain, France and Israel and the United States. The island, which has a population of 15,500 and typically hosts more than three million visitors annually, had previously worried about over-tourism, and even this week, the authorities launching Santorini’s tourism campaign insisted on the importance of “sustainable” tourism. As of June 1, cruise ship visitors must pay a charge of 20 euros, about $21.50, a measure approved last year toreduce the strain of excessive crowds on the island. But a few weeks ago, thousands of earthquakes rattled the island, sometimes every few minutes, sending most residents fleeing. The authoritiesclosed schools and deployed emergency services to the region, and experts scrambled to interpret the tremors, which peaked with a 5.3-magnitude temblor on Feb. 10. As the quakes eased in late February and early March, residents returned, schools reopened and hoteliers resumed renovations in preparation for Easter and summer visitors. Now, most tremors are less than magnitude 3, basically imperceptible, and life on the island is returning to normal. Yet the quake phenomenon remains unexplained. “We still haven’t come to a conclusion about the causes,” Athanassios Ganas, the research director at the National Observatory of Athens’ geodynamics institute, said this week. A closed path in February after seismic activity on the island. Some cliff-side areas that are prone to landslides will remain off limits until May 15 as earthquake experts seek ways to minimize risk, Mayor Nikos Zorzos told reporters at the launch of the island’s tourism campaign at the Acropolis Museum in Athens on Tuesday. “There’ll be a bit of numbness at the beginning, but the season has opened — we’re ready,” he insisted. Greece’s tourism minister, Olga Kefalogianni, told the event that Santorini was “returning to normality” and that it “remains a safe and hospitable destination,” adding that the safety of residents and visitors “is our absolute priority.”The quake crisis has also affected the island’s seasonal work force, with the tremors adding to longstanding concerns by workers over the long hours required at summer resorts and a lack of year-round benefits like health insurance, said Giorgos Diamantopoulos, the general secretary of Santorini’s association of traders and business professionals. Recruitment has already begun for the 25,000 seasonal workers whom the island’s tourism sector relies on, he said, adding that hires so far have been from Albania, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. Labor ministry statistics showed that just over 2,600 workers were hired in March. In the meantime, scientists are trying to understand the recent earthquakes. Researchers are using seismic monitors and remote-controlled underwater vehicles to study the tremors and the area’s volcanoes — though they stress that no major eruption is expected, the last one having occurred 3,500 years ago. And on Monday evening, foreign scientists joined their Greek counterparts by video link for a discussion in Athens to analyze the tremors and mild volcanic activity with the help of artificial intelligence. They agreed on one thing: The earthquake sequence was unprecedented and remarkable. As for the prospects for a strong quake occurring, Mr. Ganas said the data suggested that it was unlikely, even as the region has the potential for a temblor of up to a magnitude of 7.1. The island’s hoteliers are bracing for both geological and financial turmoil, although Ms. Manousoudaki said she was more worried about monetary losses than a possible large earthquake, given the resilience of Santorini’s buildings. “It’s true that many buildings on the caldera are basically clinging to the cliffs,” she said. “But they’re built to withstand earthquakes,” she added. “I feel safer here than I would in Athens.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Reporting from SeoulPolice Shut Area Near Seoul Court as Protesters Amass Before RulingMore than 14,000 police officers have been deployed ahead of Friday’s decision by the Constitutional Court in the impeachment case of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The authorities in South Korea were expecting tens of thousands of protesters to descend on central Seoul on Friday as the nation’s Constitutional Court decides the fate of President Yoon Suk Yeol. At least 14,000 police had been deployed to the area around the court, closing subway stations and locking down an area near a former royal palace that is popular with tourists and home to major businesses. Drones have been banned from the area, and schools, vendors and businesses have been ordered to close. The first protests were set to start at 10 a.m. local time, ahead of a possible decision by the court that could come as early as 11 a.m. Mr. Yoon was not expected to attend the reading of the decision, which will determine whether he will be formally removed from office or returned to power. Millions of South Koreans have protested, mostly peacefully, since Mr. Yoon briefly declared martial law on Dec. 3, plunging the nation into political upheaval and prompting lawmakers to impeach him. Mr. Yoon wasdetained in Januaryon insurrection charges butreleasedunexpectedly last month after a Seoul court said his detention was procedurally flawed. Ahead of the Constitutional Court’s decision, which cannot be appealed, there have been growing worries that Mr. Yoon’s supporters will clash with those demanding he be removed from office. After his arrest in January, some of Mr. Yoon’s supporters overran a local court, breaking windows and threatening the judge hearing his case.

Between the added security gates, police have parked dozens of buses and put up smaller metal fences to deter people from occupying the area. The police response is not withoutprecedent. In 2017, thousands of people tried to cross the police barricade near the court after it ruled that the president, Park Geun-hye, should be removed from office. At least four people died during the protests. On the eve of the Constitutional Court’s ruling this time, South Korea’s interim leader, Han Duck-soo, called on the nation to respect the decision “with calm.”“The government will not tolerate any illegal or violent acts,” he said on Wednesday, urging politicians not to incite violence. “This is a time to put the stability and fate of our community ahead of political interests.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Here’s the latest.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/03/world/south-korea-yoon/heres-the-latest,2025-04-04T00:06:23Z,World,,,,,,"The nation’s top court unanimously upheld the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, clearing the way for the election of a new president. Reporting from SeoulSouth Korea’s top court voted unanimously to dismiss the country’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, on Friday. The decision clears the way for the election of a new leader after months of political turmoil that has tested its democratic guardrails. In a ruling that millions of South Koreans watched on live television, the Constitutional Court’s eight justices endorsed the National Assembly’s decision to impeach Mr. Yoon for his failed attempt to place his country under martial law in December. With that ruling, Mr. Yoon, who had been suspended from office since the parliamentary vote on Dec. 14, was formally unseated. Mr. Yoon’s governing party said that it “humbly” accepted Friday’s ruling, which removed him from office immediately. He has no immediate way back into public office. An official removed by impeachment cannot hold public office for five years, according to South Korea’s constitution, and a president can serve only one five-year term. Lee Jae-myung, the opposition leader who is expected to run for president, said the ruling had restored democracy. “Today marks the beginning of a true South Korea,” he said at a news conference. In the months since the brief declaration of martial law, the country has faced a series of crises as it struggled with uncertainty over its political leadership. In December, thedeadliest aviation disasteron South Korean soil killed 179 people, while in March the country suffered itsworst wildfires on record. President Trump’s steep tariffs have also rattled South Korea, a major U.S. trade partner. The country will hold a national election within 60 days to choose Mr. Yoon’s successor. His formal removal from the presidency was the most critical moment in the political upheaval that Mr. Yoon unleashed when he declared martial law on Dec. 3. After the decision was announced, protesters supporting Mr. Yoon’s removalreacted with hugs and screams. At a rally of supporters of Mr. Yoon near his residence, there was loud booing. Here’s what else to know: New election: The National Election Commission is expected to announce the date in the coming days. Mr. Lee, who lost to Mr. Yoon by a whisker in 2022, is widely expected to win the main opposition party’s nomination. Polls show that he would probably win if an election were held now. No strong front-runner has emerged in Mr. Yoon’s party. Criminal trial: Mr. Yoon has been fighting criminalcharges of leading an insurrectionover the imposition of martial law, in a separate trial that began in February. The Constitutional Court’s ruling does not directly affect those charges. Impeachment history: Mr. Yoon is the second president in South Korean history to leave office through impeachment.

Protesters supporting Yoon Suk Yeol sat quietly near his residence after the Constitutional Court announced its decision to remove him from office. South Korea’s former president still faces criminal charges of leading an insurrection when he declared martial law. If found guilty, he could be imprisoned for life. Yoon Suk Yeol’s political career may be over, but his troubles are not. Ex-President Yoon, a former prosecutor, was removed from office by the Constitutional Court on Friday. But he still faces criminal charges of leading an insurrection over his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. A separate trial on those charges began in February and is ongoing. Prosecutors say that Mr. Yooncommitted insurrectionwhen he banned all political activities and ordered military commanders to break the National Assembly’s doors down “with axes” or “by shooting, if necessary” and “drag out” lawmakers. Mr. Yoon has repeatedly rejected the claims of orchestrating an insurrection. He said that he declared martial law to protect the nation from “anti-state forces” who infiltrated the government. If the court finds Mr. Yoon guilty, he could face a long prison term. But many of South Korea’s former imprisoned presidents, including Park Geun-hye, who was convicted of bribery, have ended up being released early. Ms. Park was pardonedin 2021 by then-president Moon Jae-in, less than five years into her 20-year prison term. The criminal case will not be directly affected by the Constitutional Court ruling that upheld his impeachment. Mr. Yoon’s time in office was plagued with problems and scandals. After his narrow electoral win in 2022, he soon became a deeplyunpopular and divisiveleader. As president Mr. Yoon used lawsuits, state regulators and criminal investigations toclamp down on speechthat he called disinformation, efforts that were largely aimed at news organizations. The police and prosecutors repeatedly raided the homes and newsrooms of journalists whom his office accused of spreading “fake news.”Mr. Yoon was also accused of using his power to advance his own interests. He was accused of pressuring the Defense Ministry towhitewash an investigationinto the death of a South Korean marine in 2023, and vetoed a bill pushed through Parliament by the opposition calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the claim. Mr. Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, was also at the center of some of his troubles. In late 2023,spy cam footage emergedshowing Ms. Kim accepting a $2,200 Dior pouch as a gift. The episode roiled his political party and became a significant issue ahead of parliamentary elections. Relations with North Korea sankto longtime lowsafter Mr. Yoon took office. For decades, the two Koreas — which never signed a peace treaty after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce — have swung between conciliatory tones and saber rattling. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been unpredictable and bellicose, developing nuclear weapons and supplying Russia with munitions and troops for its war against Ukraine. Mr. Yoon adopted a confrontational approach and called for spreading the idea of freedom to the North to penetrate the information blackout there. He also expanded joint military drills with the United States and Japan. North Korea, under Mr. Kim, has veered toward a more hawkish stance, shutting off all dialogue with Seoul and Washington, doubling down ontesting nuclear-capable missiles, and vowing to treat South Koreanot as a partner for reunification but as an enemythat the North must annex should war break out. Mr. Yoon leaves behind a government without an elected leader and facing a presidential poll within 60 days. “It has been a great honor for me to work for the country,” Yoon Suk Yeol said in a statement released through his lawyers after he was removed from office. “I thank those who supported and cheered me despite my shortcomings. I am regretful and sorry that I could not live up to your expectations,” he said, without directly commenting on the Constitutional Court’s decision. Mr. Yoon and his wife will need to vacate the official residence where he once holed up to resist arrest, protected by barricades and scores of security guards. The couple is expected to move back into their private home in Seoul, where they had lived before Mr. Yoon’s election. But they will continue to have the protection of the presidential security services — one of the few benefits allowed for a former leader ousted through impeachment.

Still, after four months of political uncertainty, many people expressed apprehension about what lies ahead for the country. For hours, the atmosphere in the streets surrounding South Korea’s Constitutional Court in downtown Seoul had been tense. Dozens had camped out overnight in the early spring chill in the lead-up to the court’s historical decision on Friday. The crowds for and against the dismissal of the country’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, were separated by police buses and metal barriers up to 13 feet in height. As the acting chief justice began reading out the decision, filled with technical legal jargon, the crowds grew quieter, straining to hear from outdoor loudspeakers the outcome that would determine Mr. Yoon’s fate — and that of the country. Some people opposed to Mr. Yoon cheered and applauded intermittently as the reading went on. Protesters on both sides clasped their hands together in prayer. Many held up their phones to record the moment. And then, the crowd erupted. Those supporting Mr. Yoon’s impeachment reacted with hugs, screams and fists pumped in the air to the unanimous decision to remove him from office. At a rally of supporters of Mr. Yoon near his residence, there was loud booing. Some people folded over in dismay, and others loudly cursed. “It’s been so hard, but now my heart is relieved,” said Kim Ji-seon, 55, who brought her daughter to witness the verdict in the hopes that Mr. Yoon’s impeachment would be upheld. “I hope they can create a country where people can be happy.”Soon after the decision was announced, only a handful of people, some wearing “Make Korea great again” and “stop the steal” hats, were left at a pro-Yoon demonstration that was scheduled to last all day outside the presidential office. Construction workers were taking down scaffolding, and dozens of chairs had been stacked and pushed to the side. Jang Jaeeuk, 21, said he had stayed out on the street near the court overnight along with other students from his university, getting only three hours of sleep, because it was such an important day for his country. “I’m happy that the hardships of the past four months haven’t gone to waste,” he said after crying and hugging his fellow students upon hearing the verdict. “Now I feel that we can change the world and, in that sense, I’m hopeful for the future.”Supporters of Mr. Yoon near the court, who were predominantly men, said that they were deeply disappointed that the president was removed and went home. Yoon Seo-jun, 18, sitting on the edge of a sidewalk, said he was distrustful of the system that led to the impeachment and dismayed about the future of the country. “South Korea’s democracy is dead,” he said, adding that he hoped the National Assembly, which had impeached Mr. Yoon, would be dissolved. After the decision, some South Koreans expressed apprehension about what might come next and the possibility of further political upheaval. Lee Yongseok, 27, who watched the court’s televised decision at a screen at Seoul’s main railway station, said that although he supported the verdict, he knew that others would be skeptical of the ruling and of the judges who made it. “I feel like something big is going to come to my country,” he said. Even as supporters and opponents of Mr. Yoon tried to grasp what comes next for their country, government officials were taking steps to move on. In a gesture that underlined the finality of the court’s ruling, the officials removed the presidential emblem in front of the building where Mr. Yoon used to work as president. The emblem bears the image of a mythical bird, the phoenix. Choe Sang-Hun,Chang W. LeeJun Michael ParkandVictoria Kimcontributed reporting. Protesters opposed to Yoon Suk Yeol cheered the Constitutional Court’s decision on Friday to remove him as president. The country’s Constitutional Court on Friday upheld the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, dismissing him from office four months after his short-lived imposition of martial law. South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Friday upheld the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, removing him from office four months after his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3. Protesters who have been demanding his ouster erupted in cheers at the ruling, waving flags and pumping their fists in the air. For weeks leading up to the ruling, hundreds of thousands of people protesting for and against Mr. Yoon have lined the streets of Seoul, often enduring freezing temperatures, rain and snow. At 11 a.m. local time, the court’s acting chief justice, Moon Hyungbae, began reading the ruling, which came after months of deliberation. Some 22 minutes later, he announced that all eight of the court’s justices had voted to remove Mr. Yoon from office. The now ex-president had “betrayed the trust of the people” and “severely violated the law,” Mr. Moon said. “It has been a great honor for me to work for the country,” Mr. Yoon said in a statement released through his lawyers. “I and regretful and sorry that I could not live up to your expectations.”The court ruling is effective immediately and cannot be appealed. Why was Mr. Yoon impeached? Late on Dec. 3, Mr. Yoon stunned the country when he declared martial law, but it lasted only six hours because lawmakers quickly voted to overturn it. Shortly after he made the announcement on live television, troops stormed the National Assembly building under orders to “break down the door and drag out” lawmakers gathering inside to vote down the martial law decree and arrest key figures, including the speaker of the floor. Crowds of citizens confronted the troops, and some lawmakers scaled fences to get into the assembly and vote. On the same night, Mr. Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission who attempted to search and confiscate its database. This violated the agency’s constitutionally guaranteed independence, the court ruled. Delivering the ruling, Justice Moon said Mr. Yoon had abused his duties as the nation’s commander in chief. The martial law decree did not meet the constitutional requirement for a national crisis which Mr. Yoon repeatedly said was one of the reasons he had made the extraordinary declaration. The judges said that Mr. Yoon rushed his idea for imposing martial law through a hurriedly convened Cabinet meeting on the night of Dec. 3. without proper deliberation, and that he failed to notify the National Assembly, as was required by law. Only six of the eight members on the bench needed to vote in favor to uphold the impeachment, but the decision was unanimous. What will happen next? Acting president Han Duck-soo will continue in his role until the nation elects a new president through a snap election. This must take place within 60 days from Friday, meaning early June at the latest. The National Election Commission is expected to announce the date in the coming days. Political parties will select their candidates through primary elections. Lee Jae-myungis the expected front-runner to lead the opposition Democratic Party. He has been Mr. Yoon’s political rival since the last presidential elections in 2022 when he lost to the former president by less than 1 percent of the votes. Mr. Lee has been at the helm of the political push to remove the now-impeached president. It’s less clear who will come out in front of the race to lead the ruling People Power Party. Its former leader, Han Dong-hoon, resigned in December after disagreement with both Mr. Yoon and his party over the martial law issue. Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of Seoul, and Hong Joon-pyo, the mayor of Daegu, are others who have been suggested as potential candidates.

At least 14,000 police had been deployed to the area around the court, closing subway stations and locking down an area near a former royal palace that is popular with tourists and home to major businesses. Drones have been banned from the area, and schools, vendors and businesses have been ordered to close. The first protests were set to start at 10 a.m. local time, ahead of a possible decision by the court that could come as early as 11 a.m. Mr. Yoon was not expected to attend the reading of the decision, which will determine whether he will be formally removed from office or returned to power. Millions of South Koreans have protested, mostly peacefully, since Mr. Yoon briefly declared martial law on Dec. 3, plunging the nation into political upheaval and prompting lawmakers to impeach him. Mr. Yoon wasdetained in Januaryon insurrection charges butreleasedunexpectedly last month after a Seoul court said his detention was procedurally flawed. Ahead of the Constitutional Court’s decision, which cannot be appealed, there have been growing worries that Mr. Yoon’s supporters will clash with those demanding he be removed from office. After his arrest in January, some of Mr. Yoon’s supporters overran a local court, breaking windows and threatening the judge hearing his case. The police have created a fortresslike environment outside the Constitutional Court, placing 15-foot-tall metal barriers on either side of the main avenue approaching the complex in an effort to keep the two camps from confronting each other. Between the added security gates, police have parked dozens of buses and put up smaller metal fences to deter people from occupying the area. The police response is not withoutprecedent. In 2017, thousands of people tried to cross the police barricade near the court after it ruled that the president, Park Geun-hye, should be removed from office. At least four people died during the protests. On the eve of the Constitutional Court’s ruling this time, South Korea’s interim leader, Han Duck-soo, called on the nation to respect the decision “with calm.”“The government will not tolerate any illegal or violent acts,” he said on Wednesday, urging politicians not to incite violence. “This is a time to put the stability and fate of our community ahead of political interests.”The impeached president of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, greeting supporters in Seoul last month. The Constitutional Court will announce on Friday whether Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached in December for declaring martial law, will be permanently removed from office or restored to power. Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, who wasimpeachedin December overhis failed attemptto impose martial law, will learn Friday whether he will be formally removed from office or returned to power, the nation’s top court said Tuesday. Suspense was building in South Korea as the country waited forthe Constitutional Courtto rule on Mr. Yoon’s fate. He has been suspended from office since the National Assembly impeached him on Dec. 14. In South Korea, the Constitutional Court decides whether an impeached official is removed permanently from office or reinstated. Removing Mr. Yoon would require the votes of six or more of the court’s eight justices; otherwise, he will return to office.​ The court’s decision, which cannot be appealed, is a critical moment in the political upheaval​ that Mr. Yoon unleashed when he declared martial law on Dec. 3. If ​the court removes him, Mr. Yoon will become the second president in South Korean history to leave office through impeachment. (Presidentwas the first, in 2017.) The country will quickly shift gears toward a new election; a successor must be chosen within 60 days. If he is reinstated, South Korea’s political crisis is likely to deepen. Mr. Yoon’s attempt to impose martial law angered millions of South Koreans. Even if reinstated, he will resume his presidential duties with his ability to govern considerably weakened. In a statement, the Constitutional Court said it would convene at 11 a.m. Friday to rule on Mr. Yoon’s case. It said it would allow TV stations to broadcast the ruling live. Mr. Yoon wasdetained on Jan. 15on insurrection charges, also connected to his imposition of martial law. The suspense surrounding his future intensified after a Seoul court unexpectedlyreleased him from jailon March 8, saying his detention was procedurally flawed. The court’s decision — and the ​Constitutional Court’s upcoming ruling — do not directly affect the criminal charges, which he has been fighting in a separate trial that began in February. ​A decision by the Constitutional Court to reject his parliamentary impeachment would galvanizeMr. Yoon’s supporters, who have held rallies in Seoul in recent weeks, calling the impeachment and the insurrection charge a “fraud” and demanding his return to office. But it is likely to anger a majority of South Koreans, who want Mr. Yoon to be removed, according to recent surveys. The police have beefed up security measures around the courthouse to guard against violence. Mr. Yoon unexpectedly declared martial law on Dec. 3, calling the opposition-controlled National Assembly a “monster” and a “den of criminals” that had “paralyzed” his government. It was the first time in more than four decades that any leader had tried placing South Korea, an importantUnited States ally, under military rule. The Assembly voted the measure down, forcing Mr. Yoon to rescind the order within hours. But it set off the nation’s worst political crisis in decades. South Koreans, who harbor painful memories of the past military rule, took to the streets by the thousands to call for Mr. Yoon’s ouster. Holed upwith his bodyguards in his fortified residence in central Seoul, Mr. Yoon initially resisted the efforts of criminal investigators ​to detain him. But hesurrenderedon Jan. 15, becoming the first president in South Korean history to face criminal charges while still in office. Prosecutors said that Mr. Yoon committed insurrection during the short-lived imposition of martial law when, they said, he banned all political activities and ordered military commanders to break the Assembly’s doors down “with axes” or “by shooting, if necessary” and “drag out” lawmakers. They said Mr. Yoon sent the troops to seize the Assembly and detain political leaders. The nation watched live-streamed scenes of special forces troops armed with assault rifles storming the Assembly as lawmakers were gathering there to vote against martial law. When Mr. Yoon attended hearings at the Constitutional Court in recent weeks, he vehemently rejected the charge of insurrection and said he hoped to regain office. He said he never intended to neutralize the Parliament or gave orders to arrest political leaders. The troops were sent to the Assembly to “keep order,” he said. In his final argument at the court on Feb. 25, Mr. Yoon said he declared martial law in a “desperate” struggle against the opposition, which he said had ceaselessly undermined his government with its majority power in Parliament. “Who can say our country is not in a national emergency?” he said, citing President Trump’s decision to declarea national emergencyover immigration and send troops to the border with Mexico. Mr. Yoon said South Korea was overrun with spies from North Korea and China. Lawyers who argued for his ouster on behalf of the National Assembly said the claims by Mr. Yoon were fallacious. Letting him return to office would be like allowing “a madman to drive the car again,” said one of the lawyers, Song Doo-hwan. Mr. Yoon’s former defense minister, several military generals and police chiefs are also standing trial on separate criminal charges of helping Mr. Yoon commit insurrection.

Protesters blocked armored vehicles that came to the National Assembly in Seoul in the early hours of Dec. 4, after Mr. Yoon declared emergency martial law. Judges of South Korea’s Constitutional Court presiding over the first preparatory hearing in December of a trial on the validity of Mr. Yoon’s impeachment by the National Assembly. South Korean soldiers tried entering the National Assembly in Seoul on Dec. 4. The Constitutional Court, an arbiter in a polarized nation, is about to consider whether Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment for declaring martial law was justified. For six weeks, South Korea has lurched through its worst political crisis in decades, throwing the resilience of the country’s democracy into question. On Tuesday, it takes the biggest step toward a resolution, when the Constitutional Court begins deliberating whether to remove or reinstate the country’s impeached president. The eight justices on the court will be the final arbiters on the fate of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who wasand suspended from office on Dec. 14 by the National Assembly for his short-lived declaration ofmartial law11 days earlier. The stakes are high. Rival groups of citizens have rallied for weeks, some in front of the court, either calling for Mr. Yoon’s ouster or demanding his return to office. Hard-liners on both sides have warned of “civil war” if the court does not rule in their favor. If Mr. Yoon is removed, it will be another crushing blow to the country’s conservative camp: He will be the third conservative president in a row to be ousted, imprisoned or both before or after their term ended. But if the deeply unpopular leader is allowed to return to office, it could set a precedent for future leaders to use martial law as a political tool, said Ha Sang-eung, a professor of political science at Sogang University in Seoul. “I wonder what other democracies around the world would think of that happening in South Korea,” Mr. Ha said. Mr. Yoon has vowed to triumph at the Constitutional Court. But his lawyers have said he will not attend the first hearing on Tuesday, citing fears that criminal investigators might try to detain him for questioning on insurrection charges if he leaveshis fortified residencein central Seoul. His absence is expected to cut the Tuesday hearing short. But the court can proceed with its deliberations from the second hearing, set for Thursday — with or without him. “President Yoon will defend himself at court as often as is necessary,” said his lawyer, Yoon Kab-keun. Mr. Yoon’s martial lawlasted only six hoursafter being voted down by lawmakers in the opposition-led National Assembly. But his attempt to put South Korea under military rule for the first time in four decades has unleashed a prolonged political uncertainty in a key ally of the United States, which has expressed concern over Mr. Yoon’s move. While Mr. Yoon faces a parallel criminal investigation on charges of insurrection, the focus for resolving his presidency now shifts to the Constitutional Court: Its decision could help dispel some of that uncertainty, or it could add to the turmoil if its decision angers the public. As the country’s political polarization has deepened in recent years, the court has handled a growing number of cases only it can settle: officials, prosecutors and judges impeached by the National Assembly. Mr. Yoon is the third South Korean president in the past two decades to be impeached. In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by the National Assembly for violating election law, but he wasreinstated by the court, which ruled that his offense was not serious enough. In 2017, the courtousted Park Geun-hye, another impeached president, for corruption and abuse of power. “When the country isdrifting without a skipperor without knowing who the skipper is, the Constitutional Court sets it back on course,” said Jung Ji Ung, a lawyer and president of a bar association for Gyeonggi, the populous province that surrounds Seoul. South Korea has a separate Supreme Court, but it created the Constitutional Court in 1987 as the ultimate interpreter of its Constitution. Located in Seoul’s quiet old town, the court has often attracted rival activists holding banners and loudspeakers when it neared historic verdicts. In 2005, it abolished a centuries-old practice of allowing children to adopt only their father’s family name. In 2009, it voted against a ban on nighttime protest rallies, allowing citizens to gather after hours to express their grievances, as they have in recent months for and against Mr. Yoon. In 2015, the courtdecriminalized adultery. In 2019, itstruck downa 66-year-old law that made abortion a crime punishable by up to two years in prison. As the number of impeachment cases grows, the court has become more politically important and so have its nine justices, who each serve a term of six years. Three are chosen by the president, three by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and three by the political parties. The current court has eight justices, and one vacancy. Two were selected by Mr. Yoon and his party; three by the former and current Supreme Court chief justices; and three by Mr. Yoon’s predecessor, Moon Jae-in, and his Democratic Party, the current opposition. Mr. Yoon can be removed from office if six or more justices agree he should be, but he might not be able to rely on partisanship in the court to save him. In the past, the justices have not always voted based on who backed their appointments: The court ruled unanimously to remove Ms. Park, even though some of them had been appointed by her or her party. The court’s ruling will depend on the gravity of any constitutional and legal offenses found to be committed by Mr. Yoon, said Bang Seung-Ju, a professor at Hanyang University School of Law in Seoul. It will also weigh whether a decision not to expel him would pose a greater disadvantage to the constitutional order and national interest than would his removal, such as by furthering political instability, he said. Prosecutors to the court are appointed by the National Assembly and say that Mr. Yoon committed insurrection when he sent armed troops into the Assembly, ordering them to seize the Parliament and detain his political enemies. Since he took office in 2022, Mr. Yoon has been locked in a standoff with the National Assembly, which he called “a den of criminals” when justifying his martial law decree. Mr. Yoon also violated the Constitution by banning all political activities and placing the news media under military control, prosecutors say. State prosecutors have already arrested a former defense minister and several military generals on charges of helping Mr. Yoon commit insurrection. Mr. Yoon ordered the generals to break down the doors at the National Assembly, “by shooting if necessary,” and “drag out” lawmakers, the prosecutors said. Mr. Yoon Kab-keun, the president’s lawyer, called those testimonies “corrupted.”But legal analysts including Noh Hee-bum, a former research judge at the Constitutional Court, expect the court to unseat Mr. Yoon as early as February, in order to help ease the country’s political uncertainty and because there is enough evidence against him. “It’s a matter of time,” Mr. Noh said. Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, in Seoul in 2022. Mr. Yoon, a conservative, won the presidency in 2022 by a slim margin, promising a more confrontational stance against North Korea. He quickly became unpopular and divisive at home. Choe Sang-Hun reported from SeoulPresident Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea has served a term plagued with problems and scandals following his narrow electoral win in 2022. Nowhe has been detainedby investigators over his ill-fated declaration of martial law in December. Mr. Yoon, a former prosecutor,won the presidencywith less than half the vote, by a margin of under 1 percent — a result that was widely viewed as a condemnation of his progressive predecessor rather than an enthusiastic endorsement of Mr. Yoon. As a candidate and in office he has allied himself with a wave ofanti-feminist sentiment. The president has been in a near-constant political standoff with the opposition, which controls Parliament, while his approval rating in polls has fallen sharply. His call for martial law on Dec. 3, which would have allowed him to clamp down on media and political opponents, was the first such declaration in South Korea in decades, but it was foreshadowed by some of his earlier actions in office. Mr. Yoon, who is seen in South Korea asa deeply divisive leader, accused the opposition of plotting an “insurgency” and “trying to overthrow the free democracy.”Read MoreMr. Yoon is the first South Korean leader to bedetained while in officeSince his election, Mr. Yoon has used lawsuits, state regulators and criminal investigations tothat he called disinformation, efforts that were largely aimed at news organizations. The police and prosecutors repeatedly raided the homes and newsrooms of journalists whom his office has accused of spreading “fake news.”Mr. Yoon has also been accused of using his power to advance his own interests. He was accused of pressuring the Defense Ministry toMr. Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, has also been at the center of some of his troubles. In late 2023,showing Ms. Kim accepting a $2,200 Dior pouch as a gift. The incident roiled his political party and became a significant issue ahead of parliamentary elections. Ms. Kim had also faced allegations that she was involved in a stock price manipulation scheme before Mr. Yoon’s election. The opposition-controlled Parliament passed a bill that would have mandated a special prosecutor to investigate the claims. Mr. Yoon vetoed the bill. Notably, relations with North Korea havesunk to longtime lowssince Mr. Yoon took office. For decades, the two Koreas — which never signed a peace treaty after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce — have swung between conciliatory tones and saber rattling. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been unpredictable and bellicose, developing nuclear weapons and supplying Russia with munitions and troops for its war against Ukraine. Mr. Yoon has adopted a confrontational approach and called for spreading the idea of freedom to the North to penetrate the information blackout there. He has also expanded joint military drills with the United States and Japan. Hours after Mr. Yoon declared martial law on Dec. 3, the National Assembly voted to lift the order, in a swift rebuke of the president’s drastic response to the political deadlock that had hobbled his tenure. Thousands of protesters gathered near the Assembly to call for his ouster in the weeks that followed. On. Dec. 14, Mr. Yoon was. He has vowed to fight in court to regain his power, even as the police and prosecutorsclosed in on himwith a possible criminal charge of insurrection. In a video released shortly after his detention on Jan. 15, Mr. Yoon said the investigation and warrant to detain him were illegal, but that he had agreed to subject himself to questioning in order to prevent a “bloody” clash between his bodyguards and the police. Candidates to replace Yoon Suk Yeol can start registering today, the National Election Commission said. Lee Jae-myung, the opposition leader, said the ruling to remove Yoon Suk Yeol had restored democracy. “Today marks the beginning of a true South Korea,” he said at a news conference. Lee is expected to run for president in the election to replace Yoon. A large crowd protesting Yoon Suk Yeol gathered on a street near the Constitutional Court this morning and then dispersed quickly after the announcement. Some protesters continued marching. Outside the building that served as Yoon’s presidential office, only a handful of his supporters remained at a demonstration that was supposed to last all day. Some wore hats that said “Make Korea Great Again” or “Stop the Steal.” Workers were taking down scaffolding, and dozens of plastic chairs had been stacked and pushed to the side. There is no immediate way back into public office for Yoon Suk Yeol after the Constitutional Court ruling. An official removed by impeachment cannot hold public office for five years, according to South Korea’s constitution. A president can serve only one five-year term. Yoon Suk Yeol has also been fighting criminal charges of leading an insurrection over the imposition of martial law, in a separate trial that began in February. The Constitutional Court’s ruling does not directly affect those charges. In the moments after the Constitutional Court announced its decision, the protesters who had called for Yoon Suk Yeol’s removal cheered, cried and hugged one another, while his supporters sat quietly near his residence. For many protesters, the decision is a satisfying conclusion to their monthslong campaign against Yoon. Cho Hyun-chul, 66, was hoping South Korea would now focus on more pressing matters. “We need to go back to talking about the issues that have been pushed aside because of this, like the environment and peace,” he said. Supporters of Yoon Suk Yeol, reacting after the court ruling in Seoul, on Friday. Ye Chung-ho had come to Seoul from Geoje Island in the south of the country, spending two nights on the street to support Yoon. “The constitution has collapsed. The law doesn’t exist,” said Ye, 65. “The decision is illegal.”South Korea must elect a new president within 60 days. The National Election Commission is expected to announce the date in the coming days, and political parties will start holding primaries. Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main opposition party, is widely expected to win its nomination. He lost the 2022 election to Yoon Suk Yeol by a whisker. Polls show that he would probably win if an election were held now. No strong front-runner has emerged in Yoon’s party. A little over half a mile from the court, hundreds of police officers in riot gear are still lined up along sidewalks, holding shields at their feet, as tourists, protesters and workers file past. The Yoon decision was announced nearly an hour ago, and there are no signs of violence, but the police are not easing up on security measures. One of Yoon Suk Yeol’s lawyers, Yoon Kab-keun, said the ruling was “unacceptable” and “politically inspired.” He did not say if the former president shared that view. “I feel crushed,” Yoon Kab-keun said. “The justices should have seen the forest when they made their decision, but they only saw the trees.”In a gesture symbolizing Yoon Suk Yeol’s ouster, government officials removed the presidential emblem in front of the building where he used to work. The emblem bears the image of a phoenix. “It feels so good,” said Kim Ji-seon, 55, who had come with her daughter to an anti-Yoon protest near the court. “It’s been so hard, but now my heart is relieved,” Kim said, adding that she wanted another party to take power. Yoon’s People Power Party says it “humbly” accepts the Constitutional Court’s ruling. Anti-Yoon protestors celebrating jubilantly after the Constitutional Court of Korea upheld President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment ruling, Seoul, South Korea, on Friday. The anti-Yoon protesters gathered outside the Constitutional Court cheered and shook their fists when the decision was announced. Some were in tears as they hugged each other. One protest leader led the chant, “We won!”There were cheers, applause and sighs of relief among those watching at Seoul Station, the city’s main transit hub, when the court announced its decision. South Korea’s Constitutional Court has unanimously removed Yoon Suk Yeol, the country’s impeached president, from office. President Yoon violated his duty as the nation’s commander-in-chief when he sent troops to the National Assembly in December, Justice Moon says. The justice’s statement is echoing through the streets of Seoul as it is broadcast through the loudspeakers set up by protesters on both sides. Moon Hyungbae, the acting chief justice, says President Yoon violated the “constitutional order.”"

Reporting from TorontoTwo Top Organizers of Canada’s Trucker Convoy Are Found GuiltyThe case is among the last stemming from the 2022 trucker protests, which spawned many other criminal cases, lawsuits and a public inquiry. Two main architects of protests that gridlocked Canada’s capital for weeks were found guilty on Thursday in one of the last legal cases stemming from the demonstrations that convulsed the country and disrupted billions of dollars in trade with the United States. A judge convicted the protest’s top organizers, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, in an Ottawa courthouse not far from Parliament Hill, the site of a four-week blockade in 2022 that saw demonstrators park long-haul trucks on major streets to protest pandemic-era mandates. Ms. Lich and Mr. Barber were found guilty of mischief, according to The Canadian Press, a national newswire agency, an offense involving damaging public property or disrupting people from using public property that carries a maximum 10-year prison penalty. Ms. Lich and Mr. Barber will be sentenced at another hearing. The two were acquitted of other charges, including obstructing justice, intimidating the public and counseling others to commit offenses, according to the Justice Center for Constitutional Freedoms, a nonprofit that has helped in Mr. Barber’s defense. The group has criticized the length of the proceedings against the two defendants. “If Tamara Lich and Chris Barber had played a leadership role in organizing protests against racism, transphobia or climate change, they would not have faced 45 days of trial over a period of 31 months,” John Carpay, the center’s president, said in a statement. The protests were known in Canada as the “Freedom Convoy” and  attracted a groundswell of support, particularly from the Western province of Alberta. It began as a grass-roots movement by truckers who faced vaccination requirements to cross the U.S. border. Mr. Barber owns a trucking company in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, while Ms. Lich describes herself as a political activist from Medicine Hat, Alberta, who helped raise funds to support the effort. “I love Canada, and no matter the outcome today, that will never change,” Ms. Lich said in a post on X on Thursday morning before the verdict. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked a rare emergency order that allowed the authorities to take stronger measures against the protesters, including freezing their bank accounts and deploying immense police resources in Ottawa. Pat King, another key organizer, wasconvicted of mischieflast year and was ultimately sentenced to three months of house arrest. Similar blockades formed at border crossings in cities like Windsor, Ontario, across from Detroit, preventing trucks from carrying commerce across the bridges that link the two cities. At another obstructed border crossing in Coutts, Alberta, the police founda cache of weaponsand two men were later sentenced to six years in prison for firearm possession and other charges.

Dozens of people were killed on Thursday in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The deadly strike took place as Israel was ramping up its offensive in the Gaza Strip to pressure Hamas to release more hostages being held in its captivity. The Israeli military said that it was looking into reports about the incident and could not immediately provide a comment. The bodies of 27 people killed in the strike arrived at Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, the health ministry said. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its casualty counts.

In the videos, people can be seen carrying victims, including children, to ambulances as fires burn in the background. A video filmed by Anas al-Sharif, a reporter for Al Jazeera, shows more than a dozen wounded children at the Ahli Arab hospital, including some covered in dust.

A two-month-old cease-fire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in mid-March after the two sides failed to reach an agreement to extend it.

Ex-Yankees Player Brett Gardner’s Son Died From Carbon Monoxide, Officials SayMiller Gardner, who was 14, died last month at a resort in Costa Rica. Miller Gardner, the 14-year-old son of the longtime Yankees player Brett Gardner, died of carbon monoxide poisoning while on vacation with his family last month, the Costa Rican authorities said on Thursday. A toxicology report after his death found high levels of carboxyhemoglobin, an indicator of carbon monoxide in the blood, according to a statement from Randall Zúñiga, the director of the Costa Rica Judicial Investigation Agency. Miller Gardner’s test showed a saturation of 64 percent, he said, adding that anything over 50 percent was lethal. Mr. Zúñiga said that other tests were also performed, including drug tests, but they were all negative. He said the autopsy report found telltale signs of carbon monoxide poisoning on the organs, and added that the case could be considered closed. Miller and his family were staying at a resort in Costa Rica. The family said in a statement released through the Yankees last month that Miller had died on March 21 “after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation.”“He passed away peacefully in his sleep,” the family said. The authorities said the family was staying in Manuel Antonio, a resort area on the central Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. The authorities saidat a news conferenceon Wednesday that the family’s room at the resort was next to a room with machinery and said that contamination may have occurred as a result. The resort where the family stayed, Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, did not respond to a request for comment after the toxicology results. The family said Miller “loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends.”Brett Gardner, 41, played for the Yankees for his entire major league career from 2008 to 2021. He played left and center field and was part of the Yankee World Series championship team of 2009. By 2019 he was the last remaining Yankee from that team, which was the last to win the title. A speedy left-handed hitting player, he led the league in stolen bases in 2011 and triples in 2013. His lone All Star season came in 2015. For his career, he hit .256 with 139 home runs. He scored the final run in the old Yankee Stadium in 2008. Mr. Gardner and his wife, Jessica, reside in South Carolina. They have another son, Hunter, who is 16. Jonathan Wolfe contributed reporting.

Prince Harry Expresses ‘Relief’ Over U.K. Charity Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/europe/prince-harry-charity-investigation.html,2025-04-03T14:38:48Z,World,"A British regulator said it would examine concerns about Sentebale, the charity Harry co-founded, looking at its chair as well as its trustees.",Royal Families; Ethics and Official Misconduct; Philanthropy,"Harry, Duke of Sussex; Chandauka, Sophie",Great Britain; England; Lesotho; Africa,Sentebale,"Prince Harry and Sophie Chandauka, right, the chair of Sentebale, last year. The charity’s board has since been engulfed in a bitter dispute. Reporting from LondonPrince Harry Expresses ‘Relief’ Over U.K. Charity InvestigationA British regulator said it would examine concerns about Sentebale, the charity Harry co-founded, looking at its chair as well as its trustees. Breaking days of silence after he was accused of bullying and harassment, Prince Harry said on Thursday that he welcomed news that the bitter dispute at the charity he co-founded is to be investigated by the Charity Commission, an independent watchdog group that regulates charities in England and Wales. The charity, Sentebale, has been engulfed in a public relations crisis since last week, when Harry and his co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, announced they wereresigningas patrons in solidarity with five departing trustees over a damaging rift with the chair of the board, Sophie Chandauka. Ms. Chandauka has since gone on television in Britain to airincendiary claimsagainst the former trustees and Harry, including allegations of sexism, harassment and bullying, which they have strongly denied. “On behalf of the former trustees and patrons, we share in the relief that the Charity Commission confirmed they will be conducting a robust inquiry,” Harry said in a statement issued with Prince Seeiso. “We fully expect it will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign.”The dispute between Ms. Chandauka and the prince has spiraled, with Ms. Chandauka claiming she was targeted by the publicity machine of Harry and his wife, Meghan, after an awkward encounter with Meghan at a polo match in Miami to raise money for the charity. Harry has declined to answer her specific allegations, saying he preferred to settle matters through an outside investigation. The former trustees, in turn, said they had lost confidence in Ms. Chandauka’s leadership, citing problems like a decline in fund-raising and expensive consulting contracts that they said she had signed without informing the board. “What has transpired over the last week has been heartbreaking to witness,” Harry and Prince Seeiso said, “especially when such blatant lies hurt those who have invested decades in this shared goal.”The Charity Commissionsaid it had opened a compliance caseto examine concerns about Sentebale, which operates in southern Africa but is registered in Britain. The commission said its scope would include determining whether trustees, including Ms. Chandauka, had fulfilled their legal duties. “The regulator’s focus, in line with its statutory remit, will be to determine whether the charity’s current and former trustees, including its chair, have fulfilled their duties and responsibilities under charity law,” it said in its statement. Ms. Chandauka said in astatementthat she, too, welcomed the watchdog’s decision to proceed with a case. “We hope that, together, these actions will give the general public, our colleagues, partners, supporters, donors and the communities we serve comfort that Sentebale and its new board of trustees are acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance,” she said. In an interview last Sunday with the broadcaster Sky News, Ms. Chandauka claimed that Harry’s resignation was calculated to damage the charity after he failed to oust her from her post. She said the drama surrounding the split between the Harry and the royal family had become the greatest risk to the charity. Sentebale was co-founded by the prince in 2006 to honor his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and to raise money to help young victims of the H.I.V. pandemic in Lesotho. It has expanded operations to nearby Botswana and works on issues ranging from substance abuse and gender-based violence to climate change, and how they affect young people. Among the Charity Commission’s previous high-profile investigations, it foundevidence of misconductat a foundation set up in the name of Captain Tom Moore, a decorated British Army officer who raised nearly 40 million pounds ($52.5 million) for the National Health Service by walking around his garden at the age of 99. The commission said in a report that Mr. Moore’s daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, and her husband, Colin, had “damaged public trust” by profiting from their links to the foundation.

It will go on display in an upcoming exhibition. A 3½-year-old in Israel recently made an important archaeological discovery. The child, Ziv Nitzan, was hiking with her family last month on a dirt trail about 25 miles outside Jerusalem when a small rock caught her attention. She was drawn to it, she said in an interview translated from Hebrew by her mother, because “it had teeth on it.”Naturally, Ziv picked it up. When she rubbed off the dirt, “she noticed that it was something very special,” her mother, Sivan Nitzan, said. The alluring pebble turned out to be a 3,800-year-old Egyptian amulet, engraved with the design of an insect known as a scarab and dating from the Bronze Age,according to the Israel Antiquities Authority, which later collected it. Ziv, moments after finding the ancient artifact. She said she first picked it up because “it had teeth on it,” and when she rubbed off the dirt, she saw that “it was something very special,” her mother said. It wasn’t the first time that a young hiker had stumbled upon an archaeological treasure in Israel, given its rich history. Last year, while on a hike on Mount Carmel in Haifa, a 13-year-old boyfound a Roman-era ringwith an engraving of the goddess Minerva. In 2016, a 7-year-old boy on a trip with friends in the Beit She’an Valley discovered a well-preserved,3,400-year-old carving of a nude woman. And many sharp-eyed children have unearthed coins made during periods ofRomanorHasmoneanrule. But Ziv is the youngest child known to have discovered an ancient artifact in Israel, said Yoli Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the antiquities authority, who called the find “very exciting.”Ziv found the relic nearTel Azekah, an archaeological site and an area described in the Bible as the site of the battle between David and Goliath. The amulet most likely belonged to the Canaanites, a group of Semitic people who lived in the area around 1800 B.C., said Oded Lipschits, a professor of Jewish history at Tel Aviv University who is leading an excavation at Tel Azekah. The Canaanites, like others in the region at the time, were interested in all things Egyptian, he said, and they often imported or imitated their food, style and luxury items — including seals like the one that Ziv found, which were worn like jewelry as personal talismans. Scarabs, or dung beetles, were particularly popular in talismans at the time because they were a symbol of rebirth, the antiquities authority said in a statement. (The insects lay their eggs in balls of dung, from which a new generation emerges.) Ziv’s scarab relic was most likely created in Egypt and then found its way to modern-day Israel around 3,800 years ago, Mr. Lipschits said. Tel Azekah, an archaeological site near where the relic was found. The area is described in the Bible as the site of the battle between David and GoliathBut how did it end up on a hiking trail where a child could find it? Mr. Lipschits offered an explanation. In 1898, two British archaeologists began excavating Tel Azekah — one of the first biblical sites to be exhumed in Israel — where they found an acropolis, walls of a citadel and artifacts from pre-Israelite cultures. When they were done, the man who owned the land asked them to fill the hole they had excavated so he could farm the area, Mr. Lipschits said. “So the modern layers are now inside, and the old layers that used to be very deep in the ground are now on the surface,” he explained. “And this is why people can find all kinds of ancient items like these scarabs on the surface.”Children also make excellent amateur archaeologists, Mr. Lipschits added, because they’re curious, low to the ground and unafraid to get their hands dirty. Ziv with her sisters Omer, 11, left, and Noga, 8, center, after receiving a certificate of appreciation from the Israel Antiquities Authority. In itself, the amulet that Ziv picked up “was not so exceptional,” Mr. Lipschits said — his team has uncovered dozens of similar scarabs in the area, some of higher quality. What is more important, he said, is that the family handed it over to the Israel Antiquities Authority so that it could be preserved and everyone could enjoy it. “If she put it in her pocket and kept it, we wouldn’t know about it,” Ms. Schwartz said. “We’re very happy to show it to the public.”The authority gave Ziv a certificate of appreciation for “good citizenship.” The amulet she found will be included in an upcoming exhibition of Canaanite and Egyptian artifacts at the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel in Jerusalem. Skeletons of the Roman Empire: Under a soccer field in Vienna, archaeologists have found a mass grave dating to the era when the Roman Empire was battling Germanic tribes almost 2,000 years ago, experts announced. Ancient Hunting Kit Found: The 6,500-year-old weapons, found in a cave in West Texas, could be among theoldest near-complete set of wood and stone hunting toolsfound in North America.

Mr. Milei has repeatedly and publicly lauded President Trump. Jack Nicas has covered the rise of Javier Milei in Argentina. He reported from Buenos Aires. How to Become Trump’s ‘Favorite President’: Nonstop Praise. News AnalysisJavier Milei of Argentina might not be that useful for the United States on economics or geopolitics — but he can help to fight the culture wars. The day after President Trump antagonized world leaders across the globe with his most sweeping set of tariffs yet, he was scheduled to fly to Florida and potentially see the one leader he has calledhis “favorite president.”That leader,President Javier Milei of Argentina, had flown overnight to receive an award on Thursday at a right-wing gala at Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Trump was scheduled to also be there late Thursday — Mr. Milei said Mr. Trump would receive an award, too — and Mr. Milei said he hoped the two would meet. It was Mr. Milei’s 10th trip to the United States in 15 months as president, and nearly every time, he has met Mr. Trump or Elon Musk. Mr. Trump has posited that he is reshuffling U.S. foreign policy strictly around what is good for the United States. So what can be puzzling about his elevation of Argentina to the front row of America’s allies — Mr. Milei and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy were the only world leadersonstage at Mr. Trump’s inauguration— is that the chronically distressed South American nation is not particularly important as an economic or geopolitical partner. Instead, through Mr. Milei, Argentina has offered Mr. Trump something else he appears to crave: adoration. “I love him because he loves Trump,” Mr. Trumpsaid of Mr. Mileiin a speech last year. “Anybody that loves me, I like them.”Mr. Milei has repeatedly and publicly lauded Mr. Trump. He has posted doctored images of them embracing. He hasgifted Mr. Musk a custom chain saw. And when Mr. Milei became the first world leader to visit Mr. Trump after the U.S. election, he danced around Mar-a-Lago and told the crowd, “Today the world is a much better place.”Carlos Kikuchi, a conservative talk radio host in Argentina who helped run Mr. Milei’s campaign, said that, to the Argentine leader, “having such a smooth relationship with Trump and Musk is like touching heaven.”Mr. Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., in February. Mr. Milei has translated his devotion into policy. Weeks after Mr. Trump said he would pull the United States from the World Health Organization, Mr. Mileidid the samewith Argentina. After Mr. Trump exited the Paris Climate Agreement, Mr. Milei’s governmentsaid it was looking into doing so, too. Mr. Milei fired his first foreign minister because she voted at the United Nations — as Argentina always had — against the U.S. embargo on Cuba. And after Mr. Trump began criticizing Ukraine — a nation Mr. Milei had steadfastly supported for years — Argentina abstained from a U.N. vote to condemn Russia for its invasion. Mr. Milei has also become one of the loudest voices in the culture wars, going on a global speaking tour of sorts to attack leftists, feminists and transgender people, and to laud Mr. Trump as the champion who will, in Mr. Milei’s telling,save the West from “woke ideology.”“Every time we meet with President Trump, he always says, ‘I like this guy,’” Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s new foreign minister,said this week. “He always says, ‘He is MAGA like me: Make Argentina Great Again.’”Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Milei’s work in stabilizing Argentina’s economy. Indeed, Mr. Mileihas succeeded in lowering inflation, increasing growth and balancing the budget. Yet, for the United States, Argentina remains an awkward fit as a strategic partner. The nation of 46 million is geographically separated from much of the world and has been stuck for decades in cycles of economic crisis. The two countries also sell many of the same things: corn, wheat, soybeans, meat, oil. Trade between them fell 8.6 percent to $16.3 billion last year. Argentina ranks 36th globally in buying American exports, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a research group. On Wednesday, Argentina, was still hit with the 10 percent minimum levy applied to nearly every country. But Mr. Milei, who describes himself as a radical libertarian, found a bright side. “Friends will be friends,”he wrote on social media, linking to the Queen song and then sharing posts arguing that Argentina had gained an advantage over countries hit with higher tariffs. Arguably the biggest potential prize for the United States is Argentina’s large stockpiles of strategic minerals, including lithium, a necessary component of renewable batteries. American and Chinese companies are major players in Argentina’s expanding lithium mines, and Tesla — run by Mr. Musk —buys Argentine lithiumfor its electric-car batteries. Evaporation pools for lithium extraction in the province of Jujuy, Argentina. The country has large stockpiles of strategic minerals, including lithium, a necessary component of renewable batteries. U.S. diplomats have urged the Milei administration to move away from China, including by restricting China’s access to lithium andrare-earth elements, according to a former senior Milei administration official and senior U.S. diplomat who spoke anonymously to discuss private talks. Yet Argentina’strade with China has increasedunder Mr. Milei, and China remains a larger trading partner than the United States, buying soybeans, silver and beef. So far, then, it may be Mr. Milei who has gained the most from the new friendship. Argentina is seeking a $20 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund and, as the fund’s biggest stakeholder, Washington holds the key vote. Argentine officials have said they expect to have Mr. Trump’s support. Lucía Cholakian Herreracontributed reporting.

Amelia Nierenberg reported from London. Marlise Simons writes about international justice. What Is the I.C.C.? What to Know After Hungary’s Move to WithdrawHungary said it would pull out of the International Criminal Court as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visited the country. Hungary’s announcement on Thursday thatit would withdraw from the International Criminal Courtdrew attention to the judicial body and raised questions about its reach. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced its decision to withdraw just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israelarrived for a visit. The court has issued a warrant for Mr. Netanyahu’s arrest on accusations of “intentionally and knowingly”depriving Gaza’s population of food, water, fuel and medicine. Mr. Netanyahu’s office rejected what it called “absurd and false accusations.”Here is what to know about the court and its efforts to enforce justice internationally. What is the I.C.C.? The I.C.C., established under a 1998 treaty, is the world’s highest criminal court. It has the jurisdiction to investigate and try people for what it describes as “the gravest crimes of concern” to the world: war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. But the courtcannot enforce its rulingsand relies on its member states to detain people who are accused of crimes. The court draws its jurisdiction from the Rome Statute, a treatyratified by 125 countries. The statute formally commits its signatories to arrest a wanted person who enters their soil, but members do not always comply. The court is based in The Hague, a Dutch city that is a hub for international law and justice. The court is based in The Hague, a Dutch city that is a hub for international law and justice. The International Court of Justice, which handles civil disputes between countries and is part of the United Nations, is also based there. The I.C.C. cannot try any suspects in absentia. Instead, it relies on member states to enforce its rulings with actions like making arrests, freezing assets and surrendering suspects to The Hague, where the I.C.C. has a detention center. Former President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines is currently in I.C.C. custody after beingarrested in March by Filipino authorities on charges of crimes against humanityWhich countries are not members of the court? Some of the world’s most powerful countries, including the United States, China, Russia, India and Israel,are not membersof the court. They do not honor its arrest warrants or hand their citizens over for prosecution. Hungary would be the first European Union country to withdraw from the court. Under the Rome Statute, Hungary’s decision would not take effect for a year. “Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the I.C.C.,” Fadi El Abdallah, the court spokesman, said in a statement on Thursday. The I.C.C. has said that former President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines is being prosecuted because the offenses he is accused of took place before his country’s withdrawal from the court took effect. Burundiand thePhilippineshave both pulled out of court, in response to the I.C.C. prosecutor opening an investigation against their leaders. The court has said that Mr. Duterte is being prosecuted because the offenses he is accused of took place before his country’s withdrawal took effect, although his lawyers have contested that argument. Who has the I.C.C. pursued? The court says that it has issued 60 arrest warrants. About half of those people are “at large,” likeMr. Netanyahu. Others are either dead, likeCol. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the former leader of Libya, or detained, likeMr. DuterteIsrael and GazaIn November, the court issued arrest warrants for theleaders of Israel and Hamas. On the Israeli side, the warrants were for Mr. Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant. The court also issued a warrant for Muhammad Deif, a Hamas leader, who was laterkilled in an Israeli strikeRussiaThe courtissued arrest warrantsfor President Vladimir V. Putin and another Russian official in 2023. It argued that they both bore criminal responsibility for the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has also issued arrest warrants for four other Russian officials.

Can It Use It Against Trump’s Tariffs? European leaders have said they would prefer to negotiate. If that fails, their response could go beyond anything they’ve tried before. The European Union, taken as a whole, is America’s biggest trading partner. That makes PresidentTrump’s fresh tariffsespecially painful for the 27-nation bloc — but also gives it a uniquely large amount of economic weight to throw around in response. In the hours after Mr. Trump’ssweeping tariff announcementon Wednesday, European leaders began to make clear that they plan to do so. Among the options: to impose trade barriers on U.S. services firms, in particular giant technology companies like Google who do a huge amount of E.U. business. And policymakers are already finalizing lists of jacked-up tariffs that could go into effect as soon as mid-April. Member state representatives are expected to vote on them next week, a senior European official said on Thursday, speaking anonymously to brief reporters. Officials could add to those lists in the coming weeks, in response to both auto tariffs and Mr. Trump’s freshly announced 20 percent levy on the European Union. They have not yet committed to a specific plan. Commenting on the new U.S. tariffs early Thursday morning, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the E.U. executive arm, said, “There seems to be no order in the disorder, no clear path to the complexity and chaos that is being created,” adding that Europeans felt “let down by our oldest ally.”The European Union was built around free trade and cooperation, and its leaders remain adamant that tariffs are bad for everyone. Europe is still trying to push for active discussions, and the E.U. trade commissioner saidon social mediaon Thursday that he would speak to his U.S. counterparts tomorrow. But American officials haveso far shownlittle appetite for quick resolution. Mr. Trump’s cabinet members have at times been hard to reach, or have evencanceled meetingson their European counterparts. Volvo’s Torslanda production plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. President Trump’s tariffs include levies on cars imported into the United States. While Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, has been talking with the trade commissioner, it is unclear how much influence Mr. Lutnick has over what ultimately happens. At the same time, the White House has made a habit of criticizing the E.U., with Mr. Trump expressing a consistent animosity. He has not met with Ms. von der Leyen since taking office. He has said the bloc was created to “screw” the United States. During the Rose Garden announcement of his new tariffs, he said the E.U. ripped America off in a way that was “pathetic.”Later on Wednesday, Mr. Lutnick told Fox News that Europe refused to take American beef “because our beef is beautiful — and theirs is weak,” calling it “unbelievable.”The fresh wave of tariffs are Mr. Trump’s latest move toshake up the way America’s alliances operate. The White House is already pressuring Europe to spend more on its own defense and has backed away from supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia in a way that hassent shock wavesacross the continent. The United States’ pivot on military issues is front of mind as E.U. defense ministers meet Thursday in Warsaw, and as NATO foreign ministers also gather in Brussels. Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, isat the NATO meeting. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, arriving in Brussels on Tuesday for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. But the deepening trade war is further turning the trans-Atlantic partnership into a trans-Atlantic rift, and Mr. Trump’s latest announcement could have far-reaching consequences that forever change the relationship between America and its longstanding allies. The E.U. is arguably America’s most important economic relationship. Italoneis responsible for nearly a fifth of American imports, and European consumers are a hugemarket for American servicesStill, Americans officials have made it clear that what they want is to reorder the global trading system, which has left Brussels grasping for tools that could give it some advantage in discussions. That’s where services could come in. European officials have already produced plans to put tariffs on a wide range of physical products in response to the recently imposedsteel and aluminum leviesOfficials could tariff additional goods in response tocar tariffsand the newly announced wave. But their firepower when it comes to physical products is somewhat limited: Europe sells Americans more goods than it buys from them. In services, that balance is reversed. European consumers are a huge market for American technology products in particular, from search engines to cloud services. In 2023, the European Union ran a service deficit with the United States of109 billion euros(nearly $120 billion). While that makes targeting services trade a potentially powerful tool, it is also a largely untried one. Google’s data center in Hanau, Germany. Europe is a major consumer of U.S. digital services, but may struggle to find homegrown alternatives. Brussels has several tools in its arsenal that could target services, but by far the most powerful option is a new weapon it calls its “Anti-Coercion Instrument.” Createdin 2021and in forceonly since 2023, it allows the E.U. to hit a trading partner with a “wide range of possible countermeasures.”Such measures could include tariffs, restrictions on trade in services and limits on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. That means that the E.U. could hit big technology firms, like Google. Several European diplomats said its use was a distinct possibility, should the trade war escalate. A French officialmade it clearon Thursday that online services could be in the cross hairs, and German officials also talked about the need toincrease pressureon the United States. Using the weapon requires deliberations within the E.U. and efforts to rectify the problem with the trading partner. The quickest restrictions could be fully in place is probably about six months, said Joanna Redelbach, who is counsel at the law firm Van Bael & Bellis and who has closelyanalyzedit. Still, it is a potentially powerful threat. “Once it is triggered, the commission can go very far in how it responds,” she said, referring to the E.U. executive arm, the European Commission. Using the tool would escalate a trade war that Brussels has up until this point been trying to de-escalate. And Europe often lacks homegrown alternatives when it comes to search engines or cloud services. “It would be carefully calibrated,” said Jorn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, a research institute. “It’s a difficult thing to do.”Yet for Europe, it is becoming clear that easy options are few and far between. “To prevent full escalation, we’d need to see progress over the next two to four weeks,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political research firm. But he added that the challenge, and the reality that could lead to a painful escalation before de-escalation, was that the Trump administration seemed to respond not to carrots and offers to negotiate — the tactics Europe has tried so far — but to shows of strength. “You have to punch the administration in the face,” he said. “The punch has to land.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

Reporting from Damascus, SyriaIsrael Hits Syria With New Strikes and Ground Raid as Tensions SoarIsrael defended the moves as necessary security measures, but Syria accused it of trying to destabilize the country. Syria accused Israel on Thursday of trying to destabilize the country after intense airstrikes on military bases and a deadly raid in southern Syria, part of a deepening incursion that is sharply raising tensions in the region. Since the Assad regime was ousted from Syria last year in a rapid rebel offensive, Israel has carried outhundreds of airstrikesand has deployed forces into southern Syria, in what it says are necessary security operations against potentially hostile forces. Israel’s latest ground incursion, which appeared to be one of the deepest and deadliest into Syria so far, sparked further outrage among some Syrians. Syria’s new leaders have condemned Israel’s moves, accusing Israel of violating its rights, and manySyrians fear that the incursionscould herald a long-term occupation. The Syrian foreign ministry said that “dozens of civilians and soldiers” had been wounded in airstrikes that caused the “near-total destruction” of the military airport outside the city of Hama. The Israeli military said late Wednesday that it had carried out airstrikes on “military capabilities” at bases in Syria, including one in the Hama region and another in the center of the country, as well as military infrastructure in the area of Damascus, the capital. In the south of the country, the governor’s office in Daraa said that at least nine people had been killed in attacks during an advance by Israeli forces toward the town of Tall al-Jabiye. A local activist, Ammar Jahmany, said in a telephone interview that the Israeli forces clashed with local fighters who were defending the approaches to the town. Israel said in a post on Telegram that its forces had conducted a nighttime raid. It said its forces had confiscated weapons and “destroyed terrorist infrastructure.” After the troops came under fire by armed militants, the military killed several of them, the post said. The Daraa governorate said that funerals for nine men who were killed would take place after noon prayers in the nearby city of Nawa. Mr. Jahmany, who is from Tall al-Jabiye, said that the death toll had risen to 11 and that 22 others had been wounded, five of them critically. He described the men killed in the attack as civilian volunteers who went out to defend the town, among them a tailor, a shopkeeper and construction workers. Others were wounded in Israeli drone strikes on houses in the town, he said, adding that his uncle was admitted to a hospital with a shrapnel wound in his shoulder after a drone strike on his home. Debris and military vehicles at the scene of an Israeli strike in Hama. In its airstrikes, Israel has sought to degrade Syria’s strategic military capability, bombing military bases so thoroughly as to make them inoperable, Western analysts have said. Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, told ministry employees on Thursday that the latest strikes embodied “a clear message and a warning about the future — we will not allow harm to the security of the state of Israel.”He added a warning to Syria’s new president,Ahmed al-Shara, which was widely interpreted as an accusation that Mr. al-Shara would allow Turkish troops to establish bases in Syria, reflecting Israeli concerns about having a permanent Turkish presence closer to its border. “If you allow hostile forces to Israel to enter Syria and endanger Israeli security interests, you will pay an extremely high price,” Mr. Katz said. Syria’s foreign ministry accused Israel of deliberately seeking to undermine Syria and exacerbate the suffering of its people, and called on the international community to exert pressure on Israel to stop. The Israeli airstrikes late Wednesday targeted five locations and occurred within a space of 30 minutes, the statement said. Videos of explosions, in particular those said to be at the Hama airport, were widely shared on social media in Syria, and news of the Israeli incursion in southern Syria further sparked anger. A local activist, Muhammad Haroun, posted a video of a mosque calling people to arms to resist the Israeli incursion on Wednesday night. In its statement, the Daraa governorate said that widespread public anger was reaching new levels. Six civilians were also killed in shelling by Israeli forces, and three others were killed in airstrikes in the same governorate last month, the local authorities reported.

Top Trump Aide Hosts White House Meeting With Kremlin Envoy,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/europe/russia-envoy-us-visit-trump-dmitriev.html,2025-04-03T11:37:04Z,World,The meeting between Kirill Dmitriev and Steve Witkoff was apparently the first time in years that a senior Russian official had traveled to the United States for talks with an American counterpart.,United States International Relations; Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022),"Dmitriev, Kirill A (1975- ); Trump, Donald J; Witkoff, Steven; Putin, Vladimir V",Russia; United States,,"Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and President Vladimir V. Putin’s special representative for investment and economic cooperation, in Saudi Arabia in February. Reporting from Berlin and WashingtonTop Trump Aide Hosts White House Meeting With Kremlin EnvoyThe meeting between Kirill Dmitriev and Steve Witkoff was apparently the first time in years that a senior Russian official had traveled to the United States for talks with an American counterpart. A Kremlin envoy on Thursday praised the Trump administration for hearing “Russia’s position on many issues” after two days of meetings in Washington that marked the first time in years that a senior Russian official had traveled to the United States for talks with American counterparts. The envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, met in the White House on Wednesday with President Trump’s senior aide on Russia negotiations,Steve Witkoff, according to a U.S. official in Washington with knowledge of the talks. Mr. Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and President Vladimir V. Putin’s special representative for investment and economic cooperation, said he held further meetings on Thursday “with key members of the Trump administration,” without identifying them. He said he had discussed economic matters and claimed there was “a great desire by American companies to return to Russia.” He also said he had discussed “the possibility of cooperation on rare earth metals, in the Arctic and in various other sectors.” And he said Russia was working to restore direct flights to the United States, which banned Russian planes from its airspace after Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Of course, there are disagreements on various points,” Mr. Dmitriev, speaking in Russian, told reporters in Washington, according to a video of his remarks distributed by a Russian news agency. “But there is a process and a dialogue that, in our understanding, will help overcome these differences.”U.S. officials did not immediately comment on the substance of the talks. Mr. Dmitriev arrived in Washington with two aides on Tuesday, and he and Mr. Witkoff met in the White House on Wednesday afternoon, said the U.S. official. The two officials continued talking in the evening. The talks appeared to be the latest step in Russia’s effort to improve ties with the United States. The rapprochement appeared to be hanging in the balance after Mr. Trump said last weekend that he was “very angry” at Mr. Putin for remarks that the Russian president had made on Ukraine. Mr. Dmitriev’s visit came despite sanctions imposed on him by the Biden administration thatdescribed him as “a known Putin ally.”The meeting also took place as Mr. Trump excluded Russia from theroster of countries hit by the steep tariffsunveiled on Wednesday. The Treasury Department suspended sanctions on Mr. Dmitriev for seven days to allow him to visit, and the State Department then granted him a travel waiver and a visa, said the U.S. official. The White House National Security Council referred questions about the visit to the State Department on Thursday morning, and the State Department then referred questions to the White House. Mr. Dmitriev, a 49-year-old former banker who studied at Stanford and Harvard, and worked at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, has emerged as a key emissary for Mr. Putin in the Kremlin’s efforts to build a close relationship with Mr. Trump. Mr. Dmitriev’s message, tailored to Mr. Trump’s pecuniary mind-set, has been that the United States stands to profit from closer ties with Russia. In February, Mr. Dmitriev worked with Mr. Witkoff tohelp broker a prisoner exchange that led to the release of Marc Fogel, an American teacher imprisoned in Moscow. In talks with Mr. Witkoff and other American officials in Saudi Arabia days later,Mr. Dmitriev claimed that U.S. companies had incurred $324 billion in lossesby pulling out of Russia after Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Dmitrievsaid in a social media postearlier Thursday that his meetings were about restoring the U.S.-Russian dialogue. The relationship had been “completely destroyed under the Biden administration,” he wrote, and the United States could benefit from cooperation “in international affairs and in the economy.”Mr. Dmitriev did not say whether he had discussed the negotiations over the war in Ukraine between Moscow and Washington. Those talks appear to have run aground in recent days, after Mr. Putinrebuffed the proposal by Mr. Trump and Ukraine for a 30-day cease-fire. But Mr. Dmitriev’s visit indicated that the Trump administration was continuing to reverse the Biden administration’s diplomatic isolation of Russia. In another sign of continuing engagement between Washington and Moscow, Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said this week that preparations were underway for a second round of talks aimed at easing the work of American and Russian diplomats operating in each other’s countries. U.S. and Russian officialsfirst met in Istanbul on Feb. 27for talks on unwinding years of tit-for-tat restrictions that reduced the American mission in Russia and the Russian mission in the United States to skeleton staffs. “We can see signs of progress and our U.S. partners’ willingness to lift these obstacles to the normal work of diplomats in our respective capitals,” Mr. Lavrov said.

Reporting from JerusalemIsrael Shifts Goal Posts in Gaza WarNews AnalysisIn pressing forward with its assault on the territory, Israel hopes to squeeze Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages. But other objectives have emerged. Israel’s leaders have articulated various goals for theexpanding war in Gaza, spreading confusion over how the objectives might be achieved and on what terms the renewed campaign might end. The primary aim is to squeeze Hamas into releasing the dozens of remaining hostages in Gaza. But other goals have emerged. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had “moved up a gear” in Gaza, capturing more territory, hitting militants and carving up the enclave. He reiterated his ultimate goals of crushing Hamas’s military capabilities and terminating its rule over Gaza, neither of which have been achieved in more than a year of war. The defense minister, Israel Katz, said a day earlier that the military was seizing more territory to protect its forces and border towns, suggesting the possibility of a longer-term presence. And over the weekend, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would enable what he described as the voluntary emigration of Gazans, without clarifying where they would go. People moved along a road on Wednesday that connected southern and northern parts of Gaza. If all of these different objectives have created uncertainty about what is to come, that may be intentional. The military chief, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, said on Wednesday that Israel would “preserve operational ambiguity and the element of surprise” during a field visit to Gaza. “The only thing that can halt our advance is the release of our hostages!”Israeli forces appear to be gradually dissecting the enclave into separate districts, in part to encircle and restrict the movement of Hamas fighters who have regrouped in different areas, according to analysts. But as the military attacks areas of Gaza that it had already conquered multiple times before, as well as some new ones, questions remain about what the forces can do this time that they couldn’t do in more than 15 months of fighting. “The government has not yet presented a viable diplomatic framework that will translate the military achievements into realizing the war objectives over time and justify the prices paid for them,” said Assaf Orion, a retired Israeli brigadier general who is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Israel’s ambiguity about its endgame in Gaza could also serve to satisfy the far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition and buttress his grip on power by leaving open an option of fully occupying the enclave and, eventually, building new Jewish settlements there. Wounded Palestinians after a strike last month in Gaza City. It is also unclear how the campaign will help the remaining hostages who were taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war. Hamas is insisting on negotiations as the only way to free them, demanding a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. Israel has conditioned any end of the war on the disarmament of Hamas and its leaders leaving Gaza, terms the group has refused. Former hostages have testified that their conditions in captivity only worsened as Israeli military pressure increased and that they feared being killed at any moment by their captors or Israeli bombardment. To a large extent, Mr. Orion said of Israel’s renewed offensive, “it is a development that endangers the lives of the remaining hostages.” On Wednesday, a group representing the families of hostages said they were “horrified” to wake up to Mr. Katz’s announcement about the expansion of military operations in Gaza. Israel broke a two-month cease-fire with Hamas on March 18 after talks to extend the truce stalled. In the weeks since, Israeli troops have retaken most of the Netzarim Corridor, a route dividing the northern and southern halves of Gaza. On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said Israeli forces were seizing another east-west corridor in southern Gaza. The military has recently thickened parts of a buffer zone inside Gaza’s perimeter, and it has expanded ground raids in the northern and southern ends of the enclave along withissuing sweeping evacuation orders. The World Food Program, a U.N. agency, said it had run out of the flour and fuel needed to keep bakeries in Gaza open. On Thursday, the military issued more evacuation warnings for residents of neighborhoods in eastern Gaza City ahead of operations there. That has led to the displacement of more than 140,000 people in Gaza since the cease-fire broke down,according to the United NationsMore than 1,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the cease-fire collapsed, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry said Thursday that the bodies of 97 people who had died had arrived at hospitals in Gaza in the previous day. The ministry also said that the bodies of 27 people that is said had been killed in an Israeli strike on a school turned shelter in Gaza City had arrived at a hospital. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its casualty counts and the circumstances were not clear. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports and could not immediately comment. It has in the past accused Hamas of embedding itself among the civilian population. In another tactic aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel halted the entry of all commercial goods and humanitarian aid into Gaza a month ago, leading to price gouging by local merchants and shortages. The World Food Program, a U.N. agency,saidthis week it had run out of the flour and fuel needed tokeep bakeries in Gaza openGaza health officials say that more than 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave in the war prompted by the Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials, and in which 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel believes up to 24 living hostages are being held in Gaza along with the remains of about 35 others. Adam Rasgoncontributed reporting.

Min Aung Hlaing arriving to meet survivors of Myanmar’s March 28 earthquake at a hospital in Naypyidaw, the capital. Reporting from BangkokIgnoring Protests, Thailand Opens Door to Myanmar’s Military LeaderSenior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing joined regional talks in Bangkok on Friday, a day after his army launched multiple airstrikes, despite his call for a cease-fire. For years, Myanmar’s army chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has been treated like a pariah on the global stage. General Min Aung Hlaing has made few overseas trips, other than to Russia and China, since he seized power in a coup in 2021. Long the subject of Western sanctions, he has been barred from attending meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, because of his military’s failure to implement an agreed peace plan in the country’s civil war. Anarrest warrantby the International Criminal Court last November accusing him of crimes against humanity was supposed to isolate him further. But on Friday, General Min Aung Hlaing began talks in Bangkok at a regional summit of a group of seven countries around the Bay of Bengal that also includes India and Thailand. He had planned to discuss ways that other countries could provide relief for the March 28 earthquake in Myanmar that killed over 3,000 people. On Thursday, the day of his arrival in Bangkok, his military launched multiple airstrikes in Kachin State, Karenni State and the Sagaing region in Myanmar despite his call for a cease-fire, according to a spokesman for the Kachin Independence Army rebel group, an activist in Sagaing and an aid worker in Karenni. Myanmar’s military has come under fierce criticism forcontinuing its airstrikesin the ongoing civil war and impeding the flow of aid in the days after the quake. For the general, the Bangkok visit — his first to a Southeast Asian nation since April 2021 — will give his regime the international attention it has long desired. For the Thai government, which is already sheltering tens of thousands of refugees from Myanmar in camps along the border, stable relations with the military government could be aimed at trying to manage the flow of new arrivals. But critics say the visit is the latest indication that Bangkok views human rights as irrelevant in foreign policy. “They don’t care,” said Kasit Piromya, a former Thai foreign minister. “It’s an insult to ASEAN — that’s what it is all about,” he said, referring to the 10-member Southeast Asian regional grouping by its acronym. “It’s the fear of the Burmese army, the greed, and because all of them are not democratic.”Thailand has said little about General Min Aung Hlaing’s visit beyond confirming that it was taking place. Justice for Myanmar, a watchdog group, and 318 other organizations called on Thailand to disinvite the general, saying he had no legitimacy to represent the people of Myanmar. When foreign governments and international organizations engage with the military junta, the organizations said in a statement, it “causes significant harm for the people of Myanmar” by legitimizing the junta and assisting it in its war against its people. “Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is grandstanding with Asian leaders in Bangkok following a devastating earthquake because he doesn’t care about Myanmar’s people,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “What he cares about is garnering some legitimacy through high-level visits because ever since the February 2021 coup, he has been rightly ostracized by most of the international community.”Leaders of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal were scheduled to attend the summit, along with those of Thailand and Myanmar. On Wednesday, the Myanmar militarydeclared a 21-day cease-fireto support relief and reconstruction efforts, a day after it fired on a Chinese Red Cross convoy trying to deliver food and medicine to desperate survivors. The military launched an airstrike in Karenni State on Thursday, according to David Eubank from the Free Burma Rangers, an aid organization in Myanmar. Soldiers targeted a checkpoint run by the Karenni rebels, killing one person and wounding four others, he said. In Kachin State, the military dropped bombs with jet fighters. “Since they are the ones attacking, we have no choice but to fight a defensive war,” said Colonel Naw Bu, a spokesman for the Kachin Independence Army. “They claim that armed groups should not take political advantage, yet they are the ones exploiting the situation for their own gain,” he added. “They are breaking the very rules that they set.”Later on Thursday night, the military used heavy artillery to shell the towns of Monywa and Chaung-U in Sagaing, near the epicenter of the earthquake, according to Ma May, an activist based in Sagaing. It also targeted Kani township in the Sagaing region with airstrikes, she said. General Min Aung Hlaing, a deeply unpopular leader, became even more disliked after he overthrew a democratically elected government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in the coup. Since then,the country has been at war, with groups of armed protesters and powerful ethnic armies fighting the junta. In response, the military launched a scorched-earth campaign against its own citizens with multiple airstrikes, killing thousands of people. At least three million are displaced. Myanmar’s economy has been wrecked following the coup, with millions of people thrown into extreme poverty, and criminality, such as the online scam centers that are flourishing in the country, has been exacerbated.

Reporting from LondonBritain Tried Everything, Including a Royal Invite. It Got a 10% Tariff. In spite of a prolonged charm offensive by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Trump said that the U.K. would be hit with the universal base rate levied on all countries. After all that — the chummy Oval Office meeting, the extraordinary royal invitation, the paeans to the “special relationship” — Britain and its solicitous prime minister,Keir Starmer, still got swept into President Trump’s tariffs, along with the European Union and other major American trading partners. Mr. Trump imposed his basic tariff of 10 percent on Britain, while hitting the European Union with 20 percent. That drew sighs of relief from Mr. Starmer’s aides, who said the difference would protect thousands of British jobs. They claimed vindication for Mr. Starmer’s charm offensive toward the American president; others said it was a dividend of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in 2016. Yet in another sense, it was a Pyrrhic victory: Britain was subject to the same blanket tariff as dozens of countries, even though the United States runs a trade surplus with Britain, according to U.S. statistics. Britain clearly hopes to strike some kind of trade deal with Mr. Trump down the road, which could spare it the tariffs’ lasting effect. On Thursday, Mr. Starmer told business executives that the British would react with “cool and calm heads.”The question is whether he will stick to his strategy — resisting pressure to impose retaliatory tariffs, for example — or fall into line with other countries, like Canada, in striking back against the United States. Downing Street said it would not impose tit-for-tat measures while trade talks were underway. “His strategy up till now has been perfectly understandable,” said Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London. “If I were him, I would have done the same. Now he needs to avoid confrontation for the sake of it, but there’s no point in appeasement either.”Britain was subject to the same blanket tariff as dozens of countries, even though the United States runs a trade surplus with Britain, according to U.S. statistics. Professor Portes said targeted retaliatory moves might make sense as a negotiating tactic. But an across-the-board tariff on American goods, he said, would only deepen the damage to Britain’s economy, which was sputtering even before Mr. Trump announced his measures on Wednesday. Britain has bargaining chips at its disposal, including reducingan existing 2 percent tax on digital services. Professor Portes said Britain could play hardball in other ways — for example, acting against X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, Mr. Trump’s ally. Critics have accused the platform of fomenting hate speech, while Mr. Musk has used X to campaign against Mr. Starmer’s government. If Mr. Starmer fails to extract anything more from Mr. Trump after all his efforts, it could embarrass him politically. But analysts said the bigger threat was the impact on Britain’s slow-growing economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent fiscal watchdog, said tit-for-tat 20 percent tariffs could shrink the British economy by 1 percent next year. It had forecast growth of 1.9 percent. Britain’s finances are already under extreme pressure. The chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves,increased taxes on employers and is planning large welfare cutsto cover spending on depleted services and to meet her promise to balance the budget and get debt levels down. Britain, with its small, open economy, is deeply vulnerable to the effects of a trade war. British officials, led by the ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, have negotiated energetically with the White House to avert these tariffs. They did not retaliate against previous tariffs on steel and aluminum, or on vehicles, which came into effect Thursday. Britain’s ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, during a welcome reception for Mr. Starmer at the ambassador’s residence in Washington in February. Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade minister who has been involved in the talks, said the watchword was “pragmatism.” On Tuesday, he told the BBC that Britain was in the “best possible position of any country” to reverse tariffs. Britain runs either an $89 billion trade surplus or a $14.5 billion deficit with the United States, depending on whether one cites British or American statistics. (The difference rests in part on how the two sides treat offshore financial centers like Jersey and Guernsey, which are crown dependencies.) Trade in goods, with which Mr. Trump is most fixated, is relatively in balance. Among the British exporters facing upheaval is the luxury auto industry, as carmakers like Jaguar, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin do not have assembly plants in the United States. More than 40,000 British businesses exported goods to the United States in 2023, according to customs data.

Among the British exporters facing upheaval is the luxury auto industry, as carmakers like Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin do not have assembly plants in the United States. Mr. Starmer faces a delicate calculation in deciding how to respond to Mr. Trump. Given the president’s unpopularity in Britain, analysts said Mr. Starmer and his Labour Party could reap a short-term benefit by retaliating. “Standing up to Trump might suit what he’s been trying to do, which is make Labour the patriotic party,” said Steven Fielding, an emeritus professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. It would also distance Labour from Reform U.K., an anti-immigrant party whose leader, Nigel Farage, has close ties to Mr. Trump. And it would allow Mr. Starmer to draw closer to the European Union, which is expected to impose its own countermeasures. Responding to Mr. Trump “could be a short-term political gain,” Professor Fielding said, but for Mr. Starmer in the longer-term, “any kind of tariff war could damage the economy, which will hurt his prospects for re-election.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

Police questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid claims that members of his team worked simultaneously for the state of Qatar. He is not a suspect, but two of his media advisers have been arrested. For years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has been standing trial for corruption, even as he oversees conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Now, he is locked in aseparate standoffwith Israel’s law enforcement authorities, a police investigation that has renewed opposition calls for his resignation. Known as “Qatargate,” the case hinges on the claim that Mr. Netanyahu’s media advisers were paid by a representative of Qatar to promote Qatari interests in the Israeli news media. That claim has angered many Israelis because it created the perception of a conflict of interest; for years, Qatar has hosted leaders of Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu’s recent efforts tofire the head of the Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security agency, has compounded the furor. It was the Shin Bet that first instigated the investigations into Mr. Netanyahu’s aides. Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed the case as a “political manhunt” aimed at toppling him from power. The Qatari government said in a statement that the allegations were baseless. What are the allegations? According to court records, police officers are investigating whether Jonatan Urich and Eli Feldstein, two aides to Mr. Netanyahu, tried to promote a favorable image of Qatar in the Israeli news media. They are said to have worked alongside a third person who is not named in the records. Jonatan Urich. Eli Feldstein. Both Egypt and Qatar havemediated between Hamas and Israelsince late 2023, but they have not always worked in lockstep. The court records saythe three men are suspected of trying to foster the idea that Qatar played a more important role than Egypt in diplomatic efforts to secure a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Qatari government denied this claim in its statement, praising Egypt’s “pivotal role,” and saying the countries were “working closely.”Mr. Urich and Mr. Feldstein were arrested on Monday and a judge extended their detention by three days on Tuesday. Lawyers for both men declined to comment. Who are the advisers? Mr. Urich is a former media officer for the Israeli military who has become one of Mr. Netanyahu’s most trusted strategists. He helped mastermind the prime minister’s communications strategy through several recent elections. In his autobiography, Mr. Netanyahu described him as “kind of family.”In addition to his government job, Mr. Urich alsoworks for Perception, a public relations firm owned by another sometime adviser to the prime minister, Srulik Einhorn. Asked for comment, Mr. Einhorn said that Perception had never worked for Qatar. Mr. Feldstein is also a former military press officer, and began working as a liaison between military correspondents and the prime minister’s office at the start of the war. He wasarrested in a separate caselast fall, on suspicion that he leaked classified information to a foreign newspaper. What is Qatar’s role? The court records do not suggest that Qatar worked directly with Mr. Netanyahu’s aides. Instead, the records state that the aides were directed by ThirdCircle, a U.S.-based lobbying group that represents Qatar in various countries,including the United States. Court records show that ThirdCircle paid Mr. Feldstein via an Israeli intermediary. The records do not clarify if or how Mr. Urich was compensated. Jay Footlik, ThirdCircle’s founder and aformer aide to President Bill Clinton, declined to comment. The Qatari government statement said the allegations “serve only the agendas of those who seek to sabotage the mediation efforts and undermine relations between nations.”How is Mr. Netanyahu involved? The prime minister is not a suspect in the case, but he was questioned by police officers for more than an hour on Monday evening. To make that meeting, Mr. Netanyahu was forced to depart early from his separatecorruption trial. In that case, he is accused of granting regulatory favors to businessmen and media executives in exchange for bribes and positive coverage. He denies those charges. What is the Shin Bet’s role? Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, has been closely involved with the investigations into the aides. When Mr. Netanyahu tried last month to fire the agency’s director, Ronen Bar, it fueled accusations that he was punishing Mr. Bar for pursuing the cases. Demonstrators in Jerusalem last month protesting attempts to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet and the attorney general. Mr. Netanyahu denied the claim. He said that Mr. Bar was being fired because of a breakdown of trust between the two men and because of lapses by the Shin Bet in the hours preceding Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023. Why has the case touched a nerve? For years, Qatar has hosted senior members of Hamas. Since 2018, Qatar has also sent more than $1 billion in aid money to civilians in Gaza. U.S. officialsquietly supportedthe first arrangement and the Israeli governmentdirectly requestedthe second. Still, Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents are furious that officials privy to Israeli state secrets might simultaneously represent a country that works so closely with an Israeli enemy. Mr. Netanyahu’s clash with the Shin Bet has also created the perception of a conflict of interest. More generally, the case has amplified criticism that he is fighting too many personal battles to govern effectively. And it has exacerbated fears that Mr. Netanyahu’sbroader effort to overhaul the judiciaryis rooted in personal grievance.

Hungary Says It Will Withdraw From I.C.C. as Orban Hosts Netanyahu,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/europe/hungary-icc-netanyahu.html,2025-04-03T08:38:37Z,World,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who is visiting Hungary despite facing an international arrest warrant, praised the move.",International Relations,"Orban, Viktor; Netanyahu, Benjamin",Hungary; Israel,International Criminal Court,"Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Budapest on Thursday. Hungary Says It Will Withdraw From I.C.C. as Orban Hosts NetanyahuPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who is visiting Hungary despite facing an international arrest warrant, praised the move. Hungary said on Thursday that it would pull out of the International Criminal Court, announcing its decision just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israelarrived there for a visitdespite facing an international arrest warrant. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban had made clear that it would ignore its obligations to act on the I.C.C. warrant. Instead of arresting Mr. Netanyahu upon his arrival in Budapest on Thursday morning, Hungary rolled out the red carpet and welcomed him with a military honor band at Buda Castle overlooking the Danube River. The withdrawal announcement makes Hungary the sole E.U. country to say it wants out of the international court. The move cemented Mr. Orban’s position as Europe’s odd man out — a role he relishes largely for domestic political reasons — and showcased his desire to align with the Trump administration, which shares Hungary’s contempt for key international bodies. In a message on Facebook,Gergely Gulyas, Mr. Orban’s chief of staff, said that Hungary would begin the process of withdrawing from the I.C.C. “in accordance with constitutional and international law frameworks.”A withdrawal would not take effect for at least a year, however, meaning that Hungary — by declining to arrest the Israeli leader — breached its obligations under the1998 treaty that established the court. “Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the I.C.C.,” the court’s spokesman, Fadi El Abdallah, said in a statement after the withdrawal announcement. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant in November for Mr. Netanyahu. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for Mr. Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Mr. Netanyahu’s trip to Hungary was his first since then to a country that recognized the court’s jurisdiction, raising the possibility, at least in theory, that he could be arrested. Although hevisited Washington in February, the United States is not a member of the court. Several other European countries, including France, have expressed reservations about enforcing the warrant against Mr. Netanyahu should he visit. But Mr. Orban, who in November denounced the court’s decision to issue an arrest warrant and responded by inviting the Israeli prime minister to visit, went further and stated categorically that Mr. Netanyahu would not be arrested. Mr. Gulyas, the Hungarian prime minister’s chief of staff, had floated the idea of withdrawing from the I.C.C. in February but said at the time that no decision had been made. Only two countries have pulled out of the 125-member court: Burundi and the Philippines. Both did so in response to the I.C.C. prosecutor’s opening criminal investigations into their heads of government. Venezuela has said that it might withdraw but has yet to make a decision. Mr. Orban has long reveled in positioning Hungary, a member of both NATO and the European Union, as a disruptive force within Europe. He has denounced fellow leaders as “warmongers” because of their support for Ukraine, moved closer to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in defiance of efforts to isolate him, and characterized demands from Brussels that he follow the rules as attacks on Hungarian sovereignty. He alsostalled for more than a yearin giving Hungary’s assent to NATO’s accepting Sweden as a member. Welcoming Israel’s prime minister in defiance of the international court offered Mr. Orban another opportunity to put himself in the spotlight and lure Washington’s attention. Mr. Netanyahu’s trip to Hungary was his first to a country that recognizes the I.C.C.’s jurisdiction since the warrant was issued. Over his 15 years in power, Mr. Orban has reshaped Hungary’s once vibrant democracy into what he calls an “illiberal democracy,” a transformation that some American conservatives hail as a future model for the United States but which his domestic opponents and many fellow E.U. leaders see as an increasingly authoritarian system adrift from Europe’s core values. The Hungarian prime minister faces a host of problems domestically, includingthe highest inflation rate in the European Unionand surging support for the country’s upstart opposition movement, which is led by a former Orban loyalist. The second Trump administration has appeared to show little interest in Hungary, even though the president has previously praised Mr. Orban as a “great leader.”Mr. Orban was not invited to Mr. Trump’s second inauguration, a decision that Hungary said was becauseno foreign leaders had been invited. However, several did attend, includingPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, a rival to Mr. Orban for leadership of the European right wing. While Mr. Orban delights in breaking ranks with fellow European leaders, Ms. Meloni has sought to narrow divisions, making her potentially more useful to the White House than Mr. Orban. The Hungarian leader isaligned ideologicallywith the MAGA movement but has diverged from Mr. Trump’s agenda by embracing China as an economic and diplomatic partner. Mr. Trump, a fierce critic of the I.C.C.,signed an executive order placing sanctions on the courtin February, vowing to impose “tangible and significant consequences” on people who work on investigations deemed to threaten the national security of the United States and Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has denounced bribery, fraud and other charges against him in Israel as an effort by the judiciary to derail the will of voters. Similarly, Mr. Orban has frequently condemned what he sees as judicial overreach by European courts that have ruled against Hungary over its violations of European Union rules. “We have always revolted against judicial activism,” Mr. Orban said at a November summit of European leaders in Budapest. In 2001, Hungary ratified the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court during Mr. Orban’s first stint as prime minister, but its Parliament has never incorporated its terms into the country’s domestic legal code. That omission, Mr. Gulyas suggested in February, gave Hungary wiggle room to avoid enforcing the arrest warrant against Mr. Netanyahu. The expansive propaganda machine of Mr. Orban’s governing Fidesz party has at times tilted towardantisemitic tropesin a campaign of vilification against George Soros, a Hungarian-born Jewish American financier. But Mr. Orban is a strong supporter of Israel and has embraced the country’s right-wing prime minister as a kindred spirit. Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing growing opposition to his leadership both inside and outside Israel, has denounced the warrant against him as antisemitic and a “moral outrage.”Speaking in Budapest on Thursday afternoon, he praised Mr. Orban for his “very bold stance against antisemitism.” Mr. Netanyahu also effusively thanked the Hungarian leader for deciding to quit the I.C.C., calling it a “bold and principled” move against a “corrupt organization” and predicting that other countries would follow. Hungary’s decision to withdraw, he added, “will be deeply appreciated not only in Israel but in many, many countries around the world.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Surfers Take What They Can Get in Hong Kong’s Unexciting Waters,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/asia/hong-kong-surfers.html,2025-04-03T04:01:10Z,World,The scene in the Chinese territory is concentrated at a few beaches with inconsistent swell. One intrepid surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”,Beaches; Surfing; Hobbies,,Hong Kong; Guangdong Province (China); South China Sea,," Reporting from the island of Tung Lung Chau in Hong KongSurfers Take What They Can Get in Hong Kong’s Unexciting WatersThe scene in the Chinese territory is concentrated at a few beaches with inconsistent swell. One intrepid surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”For nearly two hours on a windy Sunday in February, Henry Hurren took a beating in the waters off a largely uninhabited island in Hong Kong, trying to surf a short wave for a few moments at a time. The half-hour ferry ride there from the Chinese territory’s main island was bustling with day trippers. Mr. Hurren, 32, passed outdoor restaurants and families who had camped overnight as he hiked to the spot he paddled out from in a wetsuit. But in the water, he was alone, trying to prove there are new places to surf in a city without a lot them. The wave off Tung Lung Chau is known as a slab, a quick one that breaks on a rock. It is not the kind you picture a surfer riding smoothly toward shore in a world-class surf spot like Bali. Over and over, Mr. Hurren caught it for a few seconds before tumbling back into the chilly water. Many surfers never surf slabs, said Mr. Hurren, a nature guide who teaches surfing and shares some of the waves he finds onhis Instagram page. “It’s like a really concentrated version of surfing,” he said. The surf scene in Hong Kong — a territory that includes more than 250 islands in the South China Sea — is concentrated at a few beaches that lack consistent year-round swell. But those beaches are relatively accessible to a city of about 7.5 million people. Mr. Hurren is on a mission to find new places to surf in a city without a lot of surf. Tung Lung Chau is a popular destination for day trippers in Hong Kong. The best-known and easiest to access is Big Wave Bay on the east coast of Hong Kong Island, the main one in the territory. It is a tiny, imperfect stretch of sand next to a village that can be reached in about 20 minutes by taxi from the high rises that dot the endless skyline Hong Kong is better known for. The waves there are usually not that big. The beach is also used by swimmers and standup paddle boarders, and tensions can run high if too many people are in the water. Last year, the government began intermittently enforcing a rule against surfing at the beach, according to people who surf there. One shop near the beach commissioned a sign explaining surf etiquette, complete with an illustration of a surfer shouting a Cantonese expletive after being hit in the head with someone else’s board. Mr. Hurren has been going to Big Wave Bay since he was 5 but says he never felt entirely comfortable there and that it can be hostile to newcomers. Any secret surf spots he did not find himself were not his to share. If he wanted more people to surf, he would have to find other places. Waves like the one off Tung Lung Chau are not for everyone, he acknowledged, but he has found about a dozen more spots suitable for a range of skill levels. “The thing that makes Hong Kong surf so special is you have to believe in it for it to work for you and everyone around you,” Mr. Hurren said. “I’d say turning nothing into something is what our Hong Kong spirit is.”The sport had such a low profile when Mavis Lai, 41, was growing up in Hong Kong that she did not even know she could surf there. She first took it up at a weeklong camp in the Canary Islands after she had moved away and was working in London. After Ms. Lai moved back to Hong Kong in 2015, she worked as a surfing coach for a couple of years before becoming a sports therapist. She recalled going to Thailand and marveling at how good the local surfers were despite, like Hong Kongers, not having much surf all year. The waves were much better there, she said. “Maybe in Hong Kong we have the worst conditions ever,” she said she remembers thinking. But Ms. Lai makes the most of it. In the winter, the main surf season at Big Wave Bay, she goes there three or four times a week. She tries to schedule her work around the forecast and trains to stay fit enough to last for several hours whenever the surf is good. Winter is the main surfing season at Big Wave Bay. Big Wave Bay is the best known and easiest to access surfing beach in Hong Kong. Other Hong Kong surfers go farther, venturing across the border to the Chinese province of Guangdong. Clark Wang, who runs a surf hostel and teaches surfing in the city of Shanwei, said by phone from Bali that he has noticed an influx of people from Hong Kong. In 2023, there were only one or two, he said. Now Mr. Wang estimates that Hong Kongers account for about a quarter of Shanwei’s surfers. Rohan Rajpal, 27, who has spent the weekend in Shanwei at least six times since October, still surfs at Big Wave Bay during the week. Mr. Rajpal, who works in financial technology, said he thinks the wave in Shanwei is fun but that the water is nicer in Hong Kong. Mr. Hurren said it had taken him a decade to surf waves he had seen “just because I didn’t think it was doable.”He said he first noticed the wave he was riding off Tung Lung Chau as a teenager but began surfing it only last year. Before that, he spent years paddling out to look for the rock it breaks on. On that windy Sunday in February, an experienced surfer saw him carrying his board and stopped to ask where the waves were.

The Hindu Nation Was Fake.

A fugitive holy man, he has claimed miracle powers. Mujib Mashal and Pragati K.B. reported from New Delhi, and María Silvia Trigo from Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The Hindu Nation Was Fake. But Its Land Grab in Bolivia Was Real. Emissaries of the “United States of Kailasa,” led by a fugitive holy man, were deported after negotiating 1,000-year deals with Indigenous groups. They call themselves emissaries of the world’s first “sovereign nation” for Hindus, with its own passports and “cosmic constitution.” They claim to have created an official currency in sacred gold, managed by a “reserve bank.”Representatives of this nonexistent country have given statements at U.N. events and posed for photos with global statesmen, American congressmen andthe mayor of Newark. Their leader, a fugitive holy man, professes to be able to guide the process of reincarnation, guaranteeing that billionaires who use his services won’t be paupers in the next life. But the self-proclaimed United States of Kailasa has now collided with reality. Last week, officials in Bolivia said they had arrested 20 people associated with Kailasa, accusing them of “land trafficking” after they negotiated 1,000-year leases with Indigenous groups for swathes of the Amazon. The agreements were declared void, and the Kailasans were deported — not to Kailasa, but to their actual home countries, among them India, the United States, Sweden and China. “Bolivia does not maintain diplomatic relations with the alleged nation ‘United States of Kailasa,’” Bolivia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Kailasa’s “press office of the Holy See of Hinduism” did not respond to requests for comment. The bizarre story of Kailasa stretches back at least to 2019, when the guru known as Swami Nithyananda — a.k.a. His Divine Holiness, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism — fled India after being accused of rape, torture and child abuse. Born Arunachalam Rajasekaran in southern India, he became a Hindu monk and started his first ashram in his 20s near the tech hub of Bengaluru. He quickly built an empire across India and in cities around the world. Nithyananda was also grandiose, linking himself to long religious and royal lineages. He claimed miracle powers, like helping the blind see through a “third eye” or delaying the sunrise by 40 minutes. “I am a totality of unknown in your life. I’m the manifest of un-manifest,” he said in one sermon. “The moment you sit in front of me, enlightenment starts.”During a conversation in front of a large crowd, he endorsed the idea of “the world’s first inter-life reincarnation trust management.” Rich people like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett could invest a few billion dollars in a trust; Nithyananda said he possessed the knowledge system to ensure they got the money when they were reborn. That would be important, Nithyananda’s interlocutor said, “because it is possible Bill Gates will be born very poor, Warren Buffett may be born in some African village as a very poor guy.”When the accusations of rape and sexual assault started piling up and the government went after Nithyananda, he claimed that the cases were an anti-Hindu conspiracy “to grab my land.”It is not clear where he went after fleeing India, but reports put him in South America or the Caribbean. A couple of years later, he resurfaced with the declaration that he had founded the United States of Kailasa, which he said was the revival of past Hindu kingdoms. The new nation’s website — where “free e-citizenship” is just a few clicks away — said its sovereign lands were “in the Andean region.” Nithyananda, who is now in his late 40s, was up front about the benefits the location offered. “Many people asked me, ‘Swami ji, why did you leave such a huge empire you built in India and are sitting in a corner?’” he says in a video, referring to himself using an Indian honorific. The answer, he said, was “immunity” that made him “non-prosecutable” as the head of his own state. Since then, Kailasa had popped up now and again when its emissaries caused embarrassment for politicians around the world. In 2023, a senior official in Paraguay resigned after he had signed a memorandum of understanding with Kailasa. Earlier that year, the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, rescinded a sister cities agreement with the fictitious nation days after holding a ceremony announcing the partnership. In Bolivia, the Kailasa followers, who officials said had arrived on tourist visas, managed a photo with the country’s president, Luis Arce. There is no evidence that Nithyananda joined them there. Scandal erupted after an investigation by the Bolivian newspaper El Deber revealed the leases that the Kailasans had signed with Indigenous groups in the Amazon. Pedro Guasico, a leader of the Baure, one of the groups, said its contact with the Kailasa emissaries had begun late last year, when they arrived offering help after forest fires. The conversations eventually turned to a lease of land three times the size of New Delhi, and the Baure agreed to a 25-year deal that would supposedly have paid them nearly $200,000 annually. But when the Kailasa representatives came back with a draft in English, it covered 1,000 years and included the use of air space and the extraction of natural resources. Mr. Guasico said his group signed anyway. “We made the mistake of listening to them,” he said by phone. “They offered us that money as an annual bonus for conserving and protecting our territory, but it was completely false.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

"Netanyahu Arrives in Hungary, Finding a Rare Welcome in Europe",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-hungary-orban.html,2025-04-03T03:27:09Z,World,The visit comes as the Israeli prime minister faces an arrest warrant against him by the International Criminal Court.,"Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); International Relations; War Crimes, Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity","Netanyahu, Benjamin; Orban, Viktor; Trump, Donald J; Meloni, Giorgia (1977- )",Budapest (Hungary),International Criminal Court,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Netanyahu Arrives in Hungary, Finding a Rare Welcome in EuropeThe visit comes as the Israeli prime minister faces an arrest warrant against him by the International Criminal Court. Editor’s Note: Shortly after this article was published, Hungary announced thatit would withdraw from the International Criminal Court. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday began a visit to Hungary, confident that Europe’s self-declared bastion of “illiberal democracy” would ignorean arrest warrant issued against himin November by the International Criminal Court. The visit is Mr. Netanyahu’s first to a country that has recognized the jurisdiction of the court, raising the possibility, at least in theory, that he could be arrested. Hevisited Washington to discuss the future of Gazawith President Trump in February but the United States, like Israel, has never recognized the international court. In Hungary, the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has made clear that it will ignore its obligations as a party to a1998 treaty that established the court. Mr. Orban invited Mr. Netanyahu to visit shortly after the court issued its arrest warrant, assuring him that “the judgment of the I.C.C. will have no effect in Hungary and that we will not follow its terms.”Hungary’s expansive propaganda machine has tilted toward antisemitic tropes in itsnonstop vilification of George Soros, a Hungarian-born American financier and philanthropist who is Jewish. It has cast him as the sinister puppeteer in a vast global conspiracy backed by high finance and hidden, cosmopolitan forces. But Mr. Orban, a strong supporter of Israel, has embraced the country’s right-wing prime minister as a kindred spirit in tune with his own ethnonationalist views and reverence for national sovereignty free of foreign interference. The International Criminal Court issued the arrest warrants for Mr. Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, dealing a blow to Israel’s global standing. For Mr. Netanyahu, the Hungary visit provides a chance for him to project strength abroad and statesmanship at home at a time of growing opposition to his leadership both inside and outside Israel. By traveling to Europe, Mr. Netanyahu is signaling to the world that he remains broadly unaffected by the court’s arrest warrant, though Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza has been denounced by many European governments. He is also signaling to critics in Israel, where he is enmeshed ina growing list of domestic crises, that he retains his international stature and that business continues as usual despite the arrest this week of two of his aides. Amnesty Internationalcondemned the visit to Hungaryas “a cynical effort to undermine the I.C.C. and its work,” describing it as “an insult to the victims of these crimes who are looking to the court for justice.” Hungary’s invitation, it added, “shows contempt for international law.”For Mr. Orban, isolated within the European Union, welcoming the Israeli prime minister in defiance of the international court offers an opportunity to put himself in the spotlight and get Washington’s attention. President Trump has shown little apparent interest in Hungary since taking office in January even though he has long been an admirer of Mr. Orban. Like Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Orban faces a host of domestic problems, including Hungary havingthe highest inflation rate in the European Unionand the country’s upstart opposition movement — led by a former Orban loyalist — enjoying a surge of support. Before the November election Mr. Trump often praised Mr. Orban as a “great leader” but he did not invite him to the inauguration. Hungary said this was becauseno foreign leaders had been invited, but several did attend, including Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, a rival to Mr. Orban for leadership of Europe’s hard-right political forces. Mr. Trump, a fierce critic of the court, in Februarysigned an executive order placing sanctions on the international court, vowing to impose “tangible and significant consequences” on people who work on investigations deemed to threaten the national security of the United States and Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has vociferously denounced bribery, fraud and other charges against him in Israel as an effort by the judiciary to derail the will of voters. Similarly, Mr. Orban has frequently condemned what he sees as judicial overreach by European courts that have ruled against Hungary over its violations of European Union rules. “We have always revolted against judicial activism,” Mr. Orban said at a November summit of European leaders in Budapest, Hungary’s capital. Hungary in 2001 ratified the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court during Mr. Orban’s first stint as prime minister but its Parliament has never incorporated its terms into the country’s domestic legal code. Mr. Orban’s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, said last month that this omission freed Hungary from any obligation to act on rulings by the court. He indicated that Hungary was considering withdrawing from the court but said no decision had yet been made. Patrick Kingsleycontributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Accusations Fly in South Korean Dating Scandal After Actress’s Suicide,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/asia/kim-sae-ron-suicide-soo-hyun.html,2025-04-03T03:15:09Z,World,"The death of the actress Kim Sae-ron has plunged her former boyfriend, the superstar actor Kim Soo-hyun, into the biggest crisis of his career.",Actors and Actresses; Celebrities; Suicides and Suicide Attempts; Dating and Relationships,Kim Sae-ron (2000-25); Kim Soo-hyun (1988- ),South Korea,,"South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun gave a tearful news conference on Monday to respond to the controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in February. Reporting from SeoulAccusations Fly in South Korean Dating Scandal After Actress’s SuicideThe death of the actress Kim Sae-ron has plunged her former boyfriend, the superstar actor Kim Soo-hyun, into the biggest crisis of his career. When Kim Sae-ron wasfound deadat her home in February, she joined a growing list of South Korean entertainers who have ended their own lives. But the actress, who was 24, has generated more headlines in death than in life as her relationship with an older male superstar has come under scrutiny. The tragedy and scandal has embroiled Kim Soo-hyun, 37, one of ​South Korea’s best-known actors,​ and is packed with allegations worthy of a K-drama story line: A former child prodigy and a man 13 years her senior started dating. Not long after they broke up, the actress got into a drunk-driving incident that proved fatal to her career and suffered financial troubles, while the actor became one of the country’s richest stars. She tried but​ failed to ​stage a comeback​. Then she took her own life. The scandal also raised more serious accusations. Since Ms. Kim’s death, her family has said Mr. Kim started dating her when she was a minor, and that after they parted, a talent agency he founded had pressured her over a ​debt she was unable to repay. Mr. Kim has denied the accusations ​against him, and filed a defamation lawsuit against Ms. Kim’s family. But the scandal has already begun burning Mr. Kim’s career and highlighted the perils of ​celebrity in South Korea, where personal lives can come under unforgiving scrutiny. Stars have seen their careers ruined — or evenended their own lives— because of aggressive and sometimes malicious online rumors over everything from plastic surgeries to their romantic life. “South Koreans treat entertainers like public figures who must live up to textbooklike ethical standards,” said Bae Kug-nam, the author of several books about South Korea’s entertainment industry. That culture ​has created a deadly trap when combined with YouTubers and other influencers who have dished out sensational details of ​a star’s personal life, Mr. Bae said. Ms. Kim, a former child star, faced such an onslaught when she got into a drunk-driving incident in 2022. Amid a public furor, advertisers deserted her. Roles were canceled. Ms. Kim left Mr. Kim’s agency Gold Medalist after the incident, but still owed​ it for a large loan that was used to pay penalties for failing to fulfill contracts with production companies and advertisers. South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron in 2023. She was found dead in her house in Seoul in February. A lack of risk management training leaves many South Korean entertainers badly prepared for such ​crises, saidJeongseob Kim, a professor at the Graduate School of Culture Industry and Arts at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul. To them, a scandal often means financial​ devastation. “Stars reach incredible heights,” Prof. Kim said. “But they don’t realize that tall peaks mean deep valleys until they get into trouble.”Ms. Kim’s relationship with Mr. Kim became news when she briefly posted an old photo on ​her Instagram last year. The photo showed the two with their cheeks touching and triggered a frenzy of speculation, although Mr. Kim denied a dating relationship. Mr. Kim faced a full-blown scandal last month after ​Ms. Kim’s family took her story toHoverLab, a YouTube channel​ best known for carrying sensational content. HoverLab has released photos, video clips and text messages that it said backed its claims that Mr. Kim began sexually grooming Ms. Kim when she was under 16 and that he ignored her when she was in financial trouble. Mr. Kim and his agency have denied the claims and filed lawsuits against HoverLab as well as Ms. Kim’s family, accusing them of spreading fabricated evidence, blackmailing the actor and violating his privacy. Several days before Ms. Kim posted the photo last year, she had received a notice from Mr. Kim’s agency demanding repayment of her debt. The agency said that the notice was just a procedural step, but her family’s lawyers said she felt pressure and sought help from Mr. Kim. “She tried but could not reach Kim Soo-hyun,” said Boo Ji-seok, ​her family’s lawyer. “​She posted the photo briefly, hoping that ​it would prompt him to call her back.”Only under growing pressure ​from Ms. Kim’s family did Mr. Kim say last month that he had dated ​her for a year, after she became an adult. Ms. Kim’s ​lawyers insist that ​their romantic relationship lasted six years, from 2015​. Mr. Kim said that his denial last year was driven by ​his fear of the damage his admission would cause. “I had so much to protect,” he said during a tearful news conference on Monday, explaining that a drama series in which he stars,called “Queen of Tears,​”was being shown on television at the time. “What would happen to the actors performing alongside me, the staff who were working overnight on set and the production team who had everything staked on that project?”Brands have begun ​dropping him from their advertisements. ​Local media reported that he could face huge penalties if the scandal ​jeopardized projects ​he has been involved in, including aDisney+ show. “It will be difficult for him to maintain his ​current status,” said Prof. Kim. “The system rarely allows a second chance.”If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go toSpeakingOfSuicide.com\u002Fresourcesfor a list of additional resources.

"Some Aid Workers Killed in Gaza Were Shot Multiple Times, Officials Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-workers-gunshot-wounds.html,2025-04-02T23:14:48Z,World,The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said that nearly all of the 15 bodies recovered had gunshot wounds.,Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); Humanitarian Aid; Defense and Military Forces; Civilian Casualties; Palestinians,,Gaza Strip; Israel; Rafah (Gaza Strip),International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; United Nations; Hamas,"Members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society and other emergency services prayed over the bodies of fellow rescuers killed a week earlier. Some Aid Workers Killed in Gaza Were Shot Multiple Times, Officials SayThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society said that nearly all of the 15 bodies recovered had gunshot wounds. Days after the United Nations accused Israel of killing 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza, officials who recovered the bodies or carried out the autopsies said some of the rescue workers were shot multiple times before being buried in a mass grave. The Palestine Red Crescent Society, which had eight of its members killed and carried out the recovery mission, said that nearly all 15 bodies showed gunshot wounds, according to a spokeswoman, Nebal Farsakh. One paramedic was found with his hands and feet tied toward his body, Ms. Farsakh said. “My colleagues were shot; the bodies who were retrieved, many of them have multiple gun shots. We found all of them thrown in a mass grave, the bodies were put next to each other and covered with sand,” said Ms. Farsakh in a telephone interview from Ramallah. The deaths of the aid workers, who first went missing on March 23, have drawn international condemnation in recent days. On that day, in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, ambulances and a U.N. vehicle came under attack from Israel’s military, then went silent. On Sunday, rescue teams found 15 bodies, most in a shallow mass grave along with their crushed ambulances and the vehicle marked with the U.N. logo. The United Nations, which is typically cautious about assigning blame, accused Israel of killing them. An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani,said on Xon Monday that nine of those killed were Palestinian militants. He said Israeli forces “did not randomly attack” an ambulance, but that several vehicles “were identified advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals toward Israeli troops, prompting them to shoot. “When Hamas terrorists operate in active combat zones — while using humanitarian vehicles as cover, launching rockets from hospitals and stealing aid — Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its soldiers and citizens,” said Jonathan Harounoff, a spokesman for Israel’s mission to the U.N. Dr. Ahmad Dhair, a forensic expert at the Nasser hospital in the Gazan city of Khan Younis, examined five bodies belonging to the humanitarian workers on Monday. He said in a telephone interview from Gaza that he had found multiple bullet wounds in four of the bodies and some appeared shot at close range. The fifth was decomposed beyond recognition, Dr. Dhair said. He plans to examine the rest of the bodies on Thursday. One of the four had bruises on the wrist with linear marks on the skin, Dr. Dhair said, adding that further investigations were required to determine if any of the victims had been tied up. “Some of them were shot in the head from behind,” Dr. Dhair said. He said he also saw gunshot wounds in the torso and the chest, adding that the shoulder and elbow joints were also targeted. Dr. Dhair’s assessment was first reported inThe Guardian. Two senior U.N. officials and a senior official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies confirmed they had seen reports from colleagues on the ground who took part in the recovery mission that indicated the humanitarian workers had been shot. The officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to comment publicly. The United Nations in New York on Wednesday also gave more details of what occurred on March 23, saying the attack was a grave violation of laws protecting humanitarian workers in conflict zones. The organization called for an independent investigation. Jonathan Whittall, the head of U.N.’s humanitarian agency for the Palestinian territories, said that all the paramedics, members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society and the Civil Defense, were still wearing their uniforms and gloves when they were found. They had been traveling in marked vehicles and had not posed a threat to anyone, he added. “They were being dispatched into Rafah as Israeli forces were advancing into the area. The ambulances were hit one by one as they advanced, as they entered into Rafah,” said Mr. Whittall, who participated in the rescue operation and was among the team who found the bodies. Ms. Farsakh said the humanitarian workers had not carried any weapons and had been dispatched to aid wounded civilians caught in Israeli strikes. One member of the Palestine Red Crescent Society is still missing. And one other, who was riding in the first ambulance, was detained by the Israeli military and later released, Ms. Farsakh said. He recounted that Israel sprayed the ambulances with heavy gunfire, and two of his colleagues sitting in the front were killed, Ms. Farsakh said. Ms. Farsakh said in addition to their field findings and witness testimony indicating that Israel killed the aid workers, one of the paramedics in an ambulance called the dispatch center while they were under attack, reporting that the Israeli military had opened fire on their convoy and all of them were injured.

With Trump’s Tariffs, the Chasm Between Allies and the U.S. WidensPresident Trump announced sweeping levies on countries across the world. The tariffs create a dilemma for longstanding friends — and an opportunity for foes. President Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on America’s trading partners has widened the rift between the United States and some of its closest allies, while reconfiguring the global economic order. Mr. Trump’s plan, which he unveiled on Wednesday and is calling “reciprocal,” would impose a wave of tariffs on dozens of countries. The European Union will face 20 percent tariffs, but the heavier levies will fall on countries in Asia, hitting friends and foes alike. Security partners Japan and South Korea will face tariffs of 24 and 26 percent respectively, while China will absorb an additional 34 percent on top of existing levies. Some leaders reacted strongly to the wave of tariffs, which many see as overturning the global trade order that the United States established after World War II. “The global economy will massively suffer,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in a statement Thursday. “Uncertainty will spiral, and trigger the rise of further protectionism.”Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, at a news conference on Thursday. While many countries seemed at a loss as to how to react, at least one seized the moment to score political points. China turned the tables on the United States by condemning the tariffs as a “unilateral” violation of international rules — the same language that Washington has used to criticize Chinese efforts to redraw territorial boundaries in the East and South China Seas. “The United States has drawn the so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ based on subjective and unilateral assessments,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. “It is a typical unilateral bullying practice.”Japan and South Korea, two of America’s most stalwart allies, reacted to the tariffs with dismay. In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the tariffs “extremely regrettable” but refrained from talk of retaliation. Instead, he said his government would continue to seek an exemption by reminding the Trump administration that Japan is America’s largest overseas investor. “If it becomes appropriate for me to speak directly to President Trump, I will not hesitate to do so at the most appropriate time and in the most appropriate way,” Mr. Ishiba told reporters. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan in Tokyo last month. In South Korea, the acting president, Han Duck-soo, convened an emergency task force. He vowed to use “all government resources to overcome a trade crisis” by seeking aggressive negotiations with the United States. There was also disappointment that Mr. Trump proved unwilling to spare America’s two oldest Asian allies. “Our close partners appear to be treated similarly to our rivals,” said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now vice president of Asia Society Policy Institute. “Asian countries in particular have been hard hit, causing them sharp economic pain given their export-driven economies.”Analysts said China may see a diplomatic opportunity. Mr. Trump imposed some of the highest tariffs on the smaller nations in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, a producer of shoes and clothing bought by Americans, which now faces a levy of 46 percent. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, will be visiting the region in coming days, when he may seek to present his nation as a more reasonable and dependable trading partner. “In terms of who’s going to be there and reaping their geopolitical reward, it’s China,” said Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at Australia’s Lowy Institute. Paramilitary soldiers outside China’s Ministry of Commerce in Beijing on Thursday. Exiger, a data analytics firm, calculated that the burden from the tariffs could fall heaviest on Chinese exports, which would face $149 billion in additional surcharges, while Vietnamese goods would face $63 billion, Taiwanese products $37 billion and Japanese goods $36 billion. The firm called the announcement a “monumental policy shift that will reshape sourcing, pricing and geopolitical strategy.”In Europe, nations have announced plans to retaliate to an earlier wave of steel and aluminum tariffs, and they have been clear that they will respond to the growing trade conflict with further measures if negotiations fail — including, potentially, by creating barriers for services like big technology companies. The European Union’s willingness to push back could hurt American producers and consumers. Taken as a whole, its 27 nations account for nearly a fifth of American imports, and European consumers are a hugemarket for American services. Others nations hit by the tariffs tooka wait-and-seeapproach. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia said the United States imposing 10 percent tariffs on the country had “no basis in logic.” But Australia would not race to retaliate, he said, saying the country would not “join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth.”In Mexico and Canada, there was a sense of muted relief that they would not be subject to new tariffs beyond those previously announced. “This is good news for the country,” said Luis de la Calle, a top Mexican trade economist. “It allows us to safeguard our access to U.S. markets.”Many nations are still trying to figure out Mr. Trump’s objective inimposing the tariffsVehicles for export parked at a port in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, on Thursday. At times, he has talked about forcing automakers, drugmakers and other manufacturers to move factories — and factory jobs — back to the United States. However, Mr. Trump has also spoken of tariffs as a way to pay for tax cuts. Knowing his endgame could shape how countries respond to the tariffs. Europe, for instance, has made a forceful response by announcing retaliatory tariffs on whiskey, motorcycles, farm goods and a wide range of other products in response to steel and aluminum levies. But it may also be willing to negotiate if it knows, for example, that Mr. Trump wants a more balanced flow of trade. Many European nations are also in the same boat as Japan and South Korea: dependent on the United States for their security. These countries must now balance a need to persuade Mr. Trump to uphold American military commitments — not a given with his America First agenda — while weighing whether to retaliate for the trade measures. “These countries face a real dilemma,” said Kurt Tong, a former senior U.S. diplomat and managing partner at The Asia Group. “They can’t afford to have an antagonistic relationship with the United States, but on the other hand they are being treated badly. They will have to find a way to thread this needle.”David Pierson contributed reporting from Hong Kong; Sui-Lee Wee from Bangkok; Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul;Paulina Villegasfrom Mexico City;Ian Austenfrom Windsor, Ontario; River Akira Davis from Tokyo; andVictoria Kimfrom Canberra, Australia.

Desperation Grows in Gaza as U.N. Shutters Bakeries,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/un-aid-gaza-world-food-program.html,2025-04-02T14:56:59Z,World,Anxious residents rushed to obtain bags of flour as the United Nations warned that Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries were deepening the humanitarian crisis.,Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); Humanitarian Aid,,Middle East; Israel; Gaza Strip,United Nations; World Food Program,"A shuttered bakery after it ran out of flour in Gaza City on Tuesday. Rawan Sheikh Ahmad reported from Haifa, Israel and Lara Jakes from Rome. Desperation Grows in Gaza as U.N. Shutters BakeriesAnxious residents rushed to obtain bags of flour as the United Nations warned that Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries were deepening the humanitarian crisis. Bilal Mohammad Ramadan AbuKresh has lost his home, his job, his wife and seven other relatives during the war in Gaza. Now, as the United Nations closes 25 bakeries across the territory, he is also losing his only reliable source of food. Before Wednesday, Mr. AbuKresh, 40, said he would leave his tent in a camp for displaced people in northern Gaza at dawn and stand in line for hours at one of the bakeries, waiting for bread for his four children. “The line was unimaginable, like the Day of Judgment,” Mr. AbuKresh said on Wednesday, the day after the World Food Program, a U.N. agency,saidit had run out of the flour and fuel needed to keep the bakeries in Gaza open. But at least it was affordable, compared to the $30 he paid for a bag of pasta that he bought recently to feed his family. The lack of humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza over the past month has prompted violent competition for food and driven up prices. Mr. AbuKresh said he has resorted to selling his children’s jewelry and collecting trash to sell to scrounge up enough money just to buy a bit of food. “To secure a bag of bread for my children, I risk death a hundred times,” he said. Palestinians rushed to get the last sacks of flour distributed from a center in Gaza City, on Tuesday. As well as the bakery closures, the World Food Program said on Tuesday that it would distribute its last food parcels by Thursday, and that its remaining supplies in Gaza were expected to run out within two weeks. The announcement prompted desperate Gazans to rush to U.N. warehouses this week to haul away heavy bags of flour that were being handed out. The decision to close the bakeries came almost a month after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israelordered a haltto all humanitarian aid into Gaza, in an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting a new hostage release deal as cease-fire negotiations have stalled. Theaid has not resumedand afragile two-month trucebetween Israel and Hamascollapsed two weeks later, when Israel launched new airstrikes on the territory. The bakeries used as much as 300 tons of flour each day, producing enough bread to supply about 70 percent of Gaza’s population, Abdel Nasser al-Ajrami, head of the enclave’s bakers’ association, said in an interview. Five other bakeries in Gaza had already closed last month, he said, when they ran out of supplies. “Where will people get their food from?” Mr. al-Ajrami said, worrying aloud that Gaza was headed toward an even deeper humanitarian crisis. The United Nations has said the escalating war in Gaza has led to “unprecedented” need for aid,estimating91 percent of its population is facing acute food insecurity. For weeks, the United Nations has warned that humanitarian aid supplies were dwindling, and that attempts to gain access for aid convoys lined up at the border crossings had failed. Nearly one-third of the bread made at the U.N.-funded bakeries was distributed for free, he said, and much of the rest was sold as packets of pita for as little as 50 cents. “It was a way to support thousands of Gazans who lost their jobs and a source of income during the war,” Mr. al-Ajrami said, voicing concern that food shortages could lead to unrest. “This might cause chaos again across Gaza as people would start fighting for a piece of bread. There might be looting again,” he said. For weeks, the United Nations has sounded the alarm that humanitarian aid supplies were dwindling, and that attempts to gain access for aid convoys lined up at the border crossings had failed. It has accused Israel of routinely denying U.N. requests for broader efforts to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave, and has said the Israeli army’s no-go zones and evacuation order areas covered more than half of Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military unit responsible for coordinating aid deliveries to Palestinian territories,said in a social media poston Tuesday that 450,000 tons of assistance was delivered to Gaza during the two-month cease-fire, and less than 30 percent of it was from the United Nations. “Meaning, when the U.N. say they have 2 weeks worth of aid left in Gaza, there are plenty of other aid organizations and other actors with food aid,” COGAT said. “Much of the aid was diverted and available on the markets,” it added. “There is enough food for a long period of time, if Hamas lets the civilians have it.”In a sharp response to Israel, U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said aid must be allowed into Gaza immediately and called claims that Gaza had enough food “ridiculous.”“W.F.P. doesn’t close its bakeries for fun,” he told reporters at the U.N. headquarters in New York. “If there’s no flour, if there’s no cooking gas, the bakeries cannot open.”During the cease-fire, “we saw humanitarian aid flood Gaza,” he said. “We saw markets come back to life. We saw prices going down. We saw hostages released, we saw Palestinian detainees released. We need to go back to that.”Mr. AbuKresh said his family was living in “unimaginable circumstances” and barely surviving. “This is beyond description,” he said. “We’ve surrendered to death.”Farnaz Fassihicontributed reporting. Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints: President Trump is more aligned than his predecessoron Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition. Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks: Many Israelis were surprisedwhen Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effortto rein in the country’s nuclearprogram. Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief: Israel’s highest court began hearing a case over Netanyahu’s decision to replace one of his top intelligence chiefs — a courtroom battle thatcould open the door to a constitutional crisis. U.S. Strikes in Yemen: In closed briefings, Pentagon officials have acknowledged that there has beenonly limited successin destroying the Houthis’ vast, largely underground arsenal of missiles, drones and launchers, according to congressional aides and allies.

23 More Women Come Forward With Allegations Against Serial Rapist,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/europe/zou-zhenhao-women-rapist.html,2025-04-02T11:55:48Z,World,"Zou Zhenhao was convicted in London of raping 10 women in Britain, where he was a student, and in China.",Sex Crimes,Zou Zhenhao,China; Great Britain; London (England),University College London,"A photo made available by the London police of an apartment used by Zou Zhenhao. The court heard he would lure women to his apartments, drug them and rape them. Reporting from London23 More Women Come Forward With Allegations Against Serial RapistZou Zhenhao was convicted in London of raping 10 women in Britain, where he was a student, and in China. More than 20 women have come forward with allegations against a Chinese student in London who was convicted last month of drugging and raping 10 women in Britain and China. The Metropolitan Police in London said that 23 women had contacted them with new reports about Zou Zhenhao, 28, after he was convicted in the city last month. Some of the women live in Britain, while others live in China and other parts of the world, the police said in a statement on Wednesday. The police have previously said they believe that Mr. Zou may have attacked more than 50 women, based on hundreds of videos stored on his devices. Mr. Zou was a Ph.D student at University College London between 2019 and 2024. During his weekslong trial earlier this year in London, the court heard that he would lure women to his apartments in the city and in China, and rape them. Mr. Zou met the women on dating apps like Bumble and on online platforms, including the Chinese social media apps WeChat and Little Red Book, according to the police. He targeted Chinese students living in London, officers said, whom he may also have met at parties and student gatherings. On March 5, a jury found Mr. Zou guilty of 11 counts of rape, as well as of charges related to the possession of drugs intended for use in a sexual assault, voyeurism, and the possession of extreme pornography, prosecutorssaid. Two women testified against Mr. Zou in court, but eight others remain unidentified, thepolice said. Because the women were drugged, the police believe that some may not know what happened to them. With the conviction secured, the policeissued a public appealfor more victims to come forward. After arresting Mr. Zou in January 2024, police investigators uncovered hundreds of videos on his devices, which appeared to depict him raping and sexually assaulting multiple women. Officers also trawled through thousands of gigabytes of data that traced a pattern of Mr. Zou’s crimes. Zou Zhenhao, who was found guilty in March of raping 10 women in London and China between 2019 and 2023. Once the women were in his apartment, the police said, he would offer them a drink laced with a substance that investigators believe was butanediol, a chemical that converts to GHB,a notorious date rape drugthat depresses the central nervous system. When the women were unconscious, he raped and sexually assaulted them, while filming himself, the police said. The women’s faces were often hidden or obscured, making it difficult for investigators to identify them. But the police said that Mr. Zou often kept souvenirs of his victims, and officers found items of jewelry and clothing in his apartment. The police believe that Mr. Zou, who is originally from Dongguan in China’s Guangdong Province, followed the same tactics when he was in China, with video evidence indicating that some of the attacks took place there during the Covid-19 pandemic. The British police worked with their counterparts in China to find one of the women who testified against him. Since his conviction, two other women have come forward in China,according to the BBC World Service. One woman said he attacked her at one of his family’s villas after they went on a date. Fearing reprisal in her small home city of Dongguan, she stayed quiet until she recognized her attacker in news reports following his conviction. The other woman, who is also Chinese, said Mr. Zou had attacked her while she was a student in London in 2021. Before moving to London, Mr. Zou studied at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The police first started investigating Mr. Zou in 2023, after one of his victims, a Chinese national who was also studying in London, posted about her attack on social media to warn other women. She included references to his Guangdong accent and the fact that he wore a Rolex submariner watch. That’s when another woman recognized Mr. Zou as the man who had assaulted her after a night out in 2021. the BBC reported. The two women encouraged each other to go to the police. “Zhenhao Zou is a dangerous and prolific sexual predator, who manipulated and drugged women in order to prey on them in the most cowardly way,” Kevin Southworth, a commander in the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement. The police said that as part of their update on Wednesday they were also appealing again for any women who think they may have been attacked by Mr. Zou to come forward. “Officers believe that there are still more victim-survivors to be traced,” the statement said. A judge will sentence Mr. Zou on June 19."

Reporting from Dakar, SenegalDeath Sentences Commuted for 3 Americans Over Failed Congo CoupThe three Americans had their sentences reduced to life imprisonment ahead of an expected visit from a Trump official. Three American citizens who were sentenced to death over a failed coup attempt in the Democratic Republic of Congo have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment, according to a spokeswoman for the Central African country’s president. The three Americans were among 37 peoplecondemned to deathlast September after taking part in a May 2024 attack on the government that was streamed live and included a gun battle near the presidential palace. Security forces killed the coup leader, Christian Malanga, a minor opposition politician. But his son, Marcel Malanga, was arrested along with his high school friend Tyler Thompson and Benjamin Zalman-Polun, a business associate of Christian Malanga’s. Those three men — who are all American citizens — were singled out and granted “individual clemency,” Tina Salama, the Congolese president’s spokeswoman, said ina post late Tuesday on X. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. Congo has been trying to enlist American support against neighboring Rwanda and a rebel militia that Rwanda directs and arms, M23. Since January, M23 has torn through eastern Congo, seizing vast tracts of land and major cities. Thousands of civilians, soldiers and allied militia fightershave been killed in the rebel offensive, which has also left millionsdestitute. In aninterview with The New York Timesin February, Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, offered the United States a stake in his country’s vast mineral wealth, saying that such a deal would bring his country more security and stability. Expertsagree that U.S. pressure on Rwandacould be one of the few things that might induce M23 to pull back. But later that month, President Trump’s special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, linked the conflict to the fate of the three American citizens. “The President of Congo is holding 3 Americans now,” hewrote on X. “Perhaps it would be better if Rwanda won the war?”Marcel Malanga has denied involvement in planning the coup, saying that he and Mr. Thompson were forced to join in while visiting his father. At around the same time that Ms. Salama announced clemency for the men on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department released a statement saying that it had appointed a senior adviser for Africa,Massad Boulos. It said that Mr. Boulos would travel to Congo on Thursday and then to neighboring countries, including Rwanda, “to advance efforts for durable peace in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and to promote U.S. private-sector investment in the region.”Mr. Boulos — whose son is married to one of Mr. Trump’s daughters — has spent much of his career in Nigeria, where he is chief executive of a family business that sells trucks and heavy machinery. He was previously named as the president’s senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern Affairs after helpingpersuade Arab American votersin Michigan to support Mr. Trump, though it was unclear what exactly that role entails. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has taken atransactional approachto foreign policy, seeking deference and business deals from U.S. allies in return for help. Some Congolese observers said that in the context of a possible minerals deal, the clemency granted to the three Americans was to be expected. But others criticized their president for applying double standards to Americans and Congolese. “When we say that in Congo foreigners are treated better than citizens, here is the proof,” Sylvain-Parizel Kapay, a lawyer based in Kinshasa,wroteon social media.

The fire at the Hyde North substation near Heathrow Airport late last monthforced Europe’s busiest travel hub to closefor nearly a full day,dashing the holiday plansof travelers andscrambling flights across the world. Mr. Wicking said that on March 15, less than a week before the major power loss at the airport, he had raised the issue of thefts of wires and cables near an airport power supply that had briefly affected some runway lights. In a statement after the hearing, a Heathrow spokeswoman disputed the relevance of Mr. Wicking’s comments. “The incident Mr. Wicking referred to,” said Abbie Uzzell, “did not involve the three main incoming power supplies to the airport. This issue related to a minor substation, of which there are 250 at the airport. We were well aware of that incident before Mr. Wicking raised it.”The substation fire thatled to the power outageat Heathrow on March 21 prompted questions about Britain’s infrastructure and the lack of backup systems that could have kept the airport operational despite the interruption of power from the grid. Mr. Wicking said he believed it took too long for officials at Heathrow to switch to other sources of power, stranding passengers at airports around Europe and causing disruptions that rippled throughout the airline industry for days. He suggested that flights could have resumed by “late morning” on Friday if the airport had made better use of Terminal 5, the airport’s hub for British Airways, where partial power remained flowing from a separate power substation. “Flights could have been brought in,” he said. The closure of Heathrow affected travel worldwide, and exposed issues with the airport’s infrastructure and backup power systems. Thomas Woldbye, the chief executive of Heathrow, rejected that criticism. Under intense questioning from members of Parliament, Mr. Woldbye said that airport officials had contingency plans in place for a massive power outage and that engineers had moved as quickly as possible to reroute airport systems to alternative power sources. “We had to power down maybe 1,000 systems before we do that switch,” Mr. Woldbye said, “and then we have to switch it back on and power up 1,000 systems.”That took at least 10 hours, he said. He added that although some power was still flowing to Terminal 5, there was no way to keep the airport operating because key systems, including security cameras, fire control monitors, baggage handling, elevators, and scores of other systems had gone down. “The risk of having literally tens of thousands of people stranded at the airport, where we would have nowhere to put them, we could not process them, would have been a disastrous scenario,” he told the lawmakers. The hearing is part of the British government’surgent inquiryinto the disruption at Heathrow. Power went out just after midnight on Friday, March 21, forcing the airport to close within hours. The first plane after a partial reopeninglanded  about 18 hours after the fire began. Mr. Woldbye apologized to passengers who suffered disruptions and said his focus that day was on their protection. He called the fire at the nearby substation a “very low probability event,” saying that the “situation was unprecedented.”That answer did not appear to satisfy lawmakers, who pressed Mr. Woldbye and officials in charge of the electrical power grid about whether there should have been systems in place to prevent the airport from being plunged into darkness. Alice Delahunty, the president of UK Electricity Transmission for the National Grid, said that an investigation was ongoing into how the fire that started in a single transformer caused the entire substation to lose power. But she said that Heathrow received enough power from two other substations to run its operation. “I think it is a question for Heathrow as to how they access the remaining two inlets that were available throughout,” she said. Mr. Woldbye pointed blame back at the National Grid, saying that Heathrow pays for a resilient supply of electricity from the power company and expects there to be prevention measures and backups if power goes down. “We rely on resilience provided by our suppliers,” he said, noting that the airport is also reliant on suppliers for gasoline, water and other necessities. “We pay 135 million pounds a year for energy and the resilience setup we have with our suppliers.”Mr. Woldbye said the airport will be conducting a review of the incident and the response, and will be talking to regulators, airlines and energy companies about how to confront similar issues in the future, even if they are rare.

Why Was This the Only High-Rise in Bangkok to Topple After the Quake?,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/asia/earthquake-bangkok-collapse.html,2025-04-02T09:55:12Z,World,Workers said poor-quality materials were used during construction by a Chinese developer as it sought to cut costs.

Reporting from BangkokWhy Was This the Only High-Rise in Bangkok to Topple After the Quake? Workers said poor-quality materials were used during construction by a Chinese developer as it sought to cut costs. Investigators also said they found substandard steel bars in the rubble. Only one building in Bangkok fell during the earthquake on Friday that rocked Myanmar, hundreds of miles away. Recovery efforts continue with at least 15 people killed and dozens still missing. Determining the cause could take months. But interviews with workers who had been on the site, together with early official findings, highlighted potential problems with construction design and quality. At the center of the scrutiny is China Railway 10th Engineering Group, a Chinese state-owned company with about a dozen other projects in Thailand and whose contractors tried to remove documents from the site after the disaster. Behind that Chinese company is its parent, China Railway Group — a Chinese infrastructure giant with soaring debt, a hunger for new projects and subsidiaries facing accusations of weaksafetyin several countries. Workers in Bangkok told The New York Times that China Railway 10th, which was part of a consortium constructing the building, underpaid contractors who turned to lower quality materials, and used columns narrower than usual. Thai officials testing twisted metal from the ruins said they found substandard steel bars — made by a Thai factory with Chinese owners that the authorities had shut down in December. An anti-corruption watchdog also said it had flagged construction irregularities at the 30-story tower before March 28, when fleeing workers watched the high-rise implode. “The pillars on the third floor — where I stood and looked back — the beams didn’t burst,” said Netiphong Phatthong, 38, an electrician who barely escaped, waiting at the site for news about his missing friends on Tuesday. “They crumbled as the metals inside were squashed.”Thai officials, describing the collapse as a blow to the country’s image, have moved aggressively to investigate the consortium with the $62 million construction contract for the tower. It had been meant to house government auditors. At a cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra ordered the authorities to also scrutinize all projects in Thailand involving China Railway 10th. She did not mention whether the parent company would be investigated. “We really need to find an answer,” Ms. Paetongtarn told reporters. “We need to tell the people and the world what happened in Thailand.”Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand greeting people waiting for news at the site of the building collapse on Wednesday. Under PressureThe joint venture for the 30-story tower was registered in Thailand in 2018. It included a Thai developer, Italian-Thai Development, but according to workers, daily operations were run by China Railway 10th. A promotional video that the Chinese company recently released showed drone footage of the building and praised the quality of its construction. China Railway 10th is also responsible for an airport terminal in southern Thailand that was supposed to be finished in January but wasless than 40 percent completeas of March, according to the transport ministry. China Railway 10th’s Bangkok office did not respond to emails seeking comment. The Chinese Embassy, in a statement on Facebook, urged Chinese companies to cooperate with the Thai government’s investigation. China Railway Group, the parent company, got its start building most of China’s almost 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines. But in recent years, as demand for new projects at home faded, the company and its subsidiaries have expanded their scope in a rush to bring in work. Its timing often coincided with Chinese government priorities. In 2019, as Beijing sought closer ties in the Pacific, China Railway Groupbought a dormant gold minein the Solomon Islands. Workers there told The Times that safety concerns were often ignored. Along the way, the company’s debt soared. Its 2024 annual report shows total liabilities worth $211 billion, almost double the $112 billion that the company carried five years ago. China Railway Group, an infrastructure giant, with soaring debt and a hunger for new projects. Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics and finance at the University of California, San Diego, said that when a company has such a heavy debt burden, “the pressure to generate cash flow to service debt can be quite intense.”Another China Railway subsidiary has been blamed — along with allegedly corrupt officials — for thecollapse of a train station canopyin Serbia last November, which killed 15 people. Adding strain in Bangkok, construction was behind schedule. The building was less than half-finished despite a 2020 start. Mana Nimitmongkol, president of the Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand, said the government had threatened to cancel the project in 2024 because of delays. Adding suspicion, four Chinese nationals who identified themselves as subcontractors were caught on camera the day after the earthquake removing documents from an office behind the rubble. They told the authorities it was for an insurance claim. The police seized the documents; the men were detained, then released. Rescuers bringing down a body of a victim from the rubble on Wednesday. Weak MaterialsStructural engineers in Bangkok struggled to understand why the building buckled all at once. Pennung Warnitchai, director of Earthquake Research Center of Thailand, who helped draft Bangkok’s earthquake-resistant standards, said that the building should have been able to stay up. The ground motion detected in Bangkok after the earthquake struck, he said, “was about one-third to one-half of the level we consider in the design of typical buildings.”Thailand generally follows an American model for earthquake protection, which means skyscrapers start with a reinforced concrete core. The core is typically arectangular shaft in a building’s center, with floors and vertical support columns emanating outward. In the case of the building that fell, the designers set the core off-center, said Mr. Pennung, adding that he saw the plans. Other buildings with a similar design did not collapse. But because the earthquake’s distance created longer periods between waves of motion, and with much of Bangkok built on soft soil, he said, the building may have both swayed and twisted, compounding the danger. Mr. Pennung and several other engineers stressed it was too early to determine the cause of the collapse. Steel quality, design, work standards and soil could all play a role. But he said that evidence from workers and officials gathered so far, plus video footage of the quake, suggested that the core and supporting pillars or columns gave way on the lower floors. “It seems that it collapsed from the bottom, not the top,” he said. A satellite image taken in December 2024 showing the construction of the building in Bangkok. Other experts agreed that the building did not topple so much as drop, which corresponds with accounts from workers who escaped at the last minute. Six employees from the downed building, who worked from the third to the 10th floors, said that the project often seemed unsafe. Some of the issues they reported were relatively minor: many workers wore sneakers rather than steel-toed boots; requirements for a harness on higher floors were ignored. Three workers with experience on several lower floors said the columns of the building were thinner than those they had seen at other high-rise construction sites. Apichat Chaihlao, who worked on the eighth floor, said his supervisor was so concerned that he measured the columns himself “and he said these pillars are not right.”“I didn’t think about it at that time, but now,” he added, “compared to the other projects I’ve worked on, that floor did not look sturdy.”Two subcontractors, who declined to give their names out of fear of reprisal by their employer, said Chinese managers often disregarded suggestions from Thai counterparts and used lowball contracts that led to lower quality materials. Reportsabout the China Railway Group’s subsidiary in Serbia also highlighted a lack of quality control. There, an engineer who had worked on the station with the fatal collapse said that a contractor hired by the Chinese consortium in charge had ignored design specifications and added extra concrete to the canopy. Workers inspecting the roof of a train station in Serbia after the canopy collapsed in November, killing 15 people. Nonthichai Likitaporn, director of the Thai Industrial Standards Institute, said the problems with the Bangkok building included using steel that was too weak. Samples of steel bars in two sizes that were collected from the site failed tests by the Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand for their mass, chemistry and ability to handle pressure. Other samples met the required standards, Mr. Nonthichai said, but the problematic metal was made by the same Chinese company: Xin Ke Yuan Steel Co., which had a factory in Thailand’s Rayong province. Thai authorities closed the factory in December, citing risks to safety after an accident involving gas leaks. They seized more than 2,400 tons of steel after tests found that its rebar did not meet approved criteria for its ribbing height and boron content, undermining adhesion with concrete and weakening its strength. The authorities also demanded that the company’s executives recall any steel already sold. It is not clear that they did that. The company could not be reached for comment at the phone number listed on its website. Chinese construction networks led by state-owned firms have played major roles in Bangkok’s recent building boom, adding apartments, train lines and other projects. The Thai government has increasingly close relations with China, which is Thailand’s largest investor. Last month, at Beijing’s request, Thailand deported 40Uyghur asylum seekersback to China, drawing a sharp rebuke from U.N. officials and activists who had long warned that the men would possibly face torture and imprisonment upon their return. Within China, Beijing has sought to censor coverage and discussion of the collapsed building. An explanatory story about the building’s structure by an investigative news outlet, Caixin, and a short piece by the official news agency, Xinhua, about the casualties caused by the collapse, were removed soon after they were published. But in Thailand,fears of tall buildingsare now common — and outrage has soared. “Thailand’s public sentiment has been increasingly critical of Chinese business presence and government dealings,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science and international relations at Chulalongkorn University. “The collapse of the Chinese-built building,” he added, “is likely to reinforce this critical view.”David PiersonandBerry Wangcontributed reporting from Hong Kong;Keith BradsherLi Youfrom Beijing.

"Israel Takes New Territory in Gaza, Squeezing Hamas",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-offensive-hamas-war-katz.html,2025-04-02T09:33:17Z,World,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had seized a corridor of land that would split one of Gaza’s largest cities from the rest of the enclave.,Israel-Gaza War (2023- ),"Katz, Israel (1955- ); Netanyahu, Benjamin; Trump, Donald J",Gaza Strip; Rafah (Gaza Strip); Israel,Hamas; United Nations,"The site of a strike in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Wednesday. Reporting from JerusalemIsrael Takes New Territory in Gaza, Squeezing HamasPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had seized a corridor of land that would split one of Gaza’s largest cities from the rest of the enclave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Wednesday that Israel is seizing territory in the Gaza Strip hours after his government laid out plans to take over large parts of the enclave. The announcement adds to the growingdrumbeat from Israeli officials in recent dayswho have suggested that Israel would shift tactics to hold territory in Gaza, at least temporarily, in an effort to pressure Hamas to free the remaining hostages. The officials have also asserted a vision for postwar Gaza in which Palestinians would move elsewhere — an idea vehemently rejected by much of the world. Holding territory, Mr. Netanyahu said, was meant to push Hamas to return at least 59 remaining hostages the group and its allies captured on Oct. 7, 2023. “The pressure will increase until they hand them over,” he said in a filmed statement. In the 15-month military campaign that preceded a January truce, Israeli forces stormed Gazan cities before withdrawing, leaving behind vast destruction butallowing Palestinian militants to regroupin the rubble. In the weeks after the cease-fire took hold, many Gazans returned home, but Israel resumed its attacks in mid-March. Now, the military appears to be planning to station forces in captured territory. The defense minister, Israel Katz, on Wednesday said newly captured areas would be “added to the security zones” that the military currently maintains in Gaza, including a buffer along the enclave’s borders with Egypt and Israel, and much of a key road in the center of the enclave. Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would establish a corridor, which he hinted would cut off territory in the southern city of Rafah from the rest of the strip. The so-called Morag Corridor appeared to take its name from a former Israeli settlement in southern Gaza, from which Israel withdrew in 2005. It was not clear how large the corridor was or how long Israel intended to hold it. The military said that it would not provide details beyond Mr. Netanyahu’s statement. In the northern town of Beit Lahia, Palestinians took to the streets to protest against the war and call on Hamas to give up power. “Hamas out,” protesters chanted Wednesday at the rally. “Enough death,” they shouted. Earlier this week, Mr. Netanyahu set forth demands for a postwar Gaza, including Hamas laying down its arms, Israeli security control in Gaza and what he called voluntary migration for Gazans. It’s unclear whether the recent moves by Israeli amount to a bid to pressure Hamas to negotiate and make concessions, or indicate a more comprehensive plan for Gaza. Either way, Israel would face significant pushback, and it is uncertain whether either side could force the other to accept its terms for an agreement through military means. Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly conditioned the end of the war on the dismantling of Hamas’s military wing and government, but his comments offered a detailed vision of how he thought that could be achieved. For their part, Hamas officials have rejected ideas calling on them to give up their weapons, send their leaders into exile or accept the depopulation of Gaza. Hamas is demanding an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal in exchange for the release of all the hostages still held in Gaza. Even if Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza or were forced out, it’s not clear where they would be able to resettle. Arab countries, including neighboring Egypt,have rejected proposalsfirst publicly floated by President Trump to relocate them to their soil, with some calling the ideas tantamount to ethnic cleansing. Israeli military vehicles along the border with the Gaza Strip last month. The Israeli military resumed its attacks against Hamas in Gaza on March 18 after Israel and Hamas failed to reach an agreement to extend the cease-fire that started in January. On Wednesday, Israeli forces struck a United Nations building in the northern city of Jabaliya where several hundred people were sheltering, said Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. The Israeli military said it had attacked Hamas militants hiding inside a “command-and-control” center, without providing evidence. Israel has accused Hamas of embedding in civilian areas. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency rescue service under the Hamas-run interior ministry, said in a statement that seven people had been killed. The group does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. Since the cease-fire collapsed, Israeli forces have beenadvancing deeper into the Gaza Strip, including in the southern city of Rafah, though they have not been sweeping through Palestinian cities as they did before the truce. Both sides have been speaking to mediators abouta potential dealto halt the fighting — so far without success. The Israeli military hasissued sweeping evacuation ordersfor parts of Gaza. More than 200,000 people in the enclave have been displaced since the cease-fire broke down, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say that more than 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave since the war began after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That attack killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage to Gaza. Gabby Sobelman,Rawan Sheikh AhmadandJohnatan Reisscontributed reporting.

Can You Hear Me?’: One Family’s Story of Death in GazaThe Abu Teirs thought the Israel-Hamas cease-fire might mean they could start to rebuild their lives. But a new round of Israeli airstrikes dashed those dreams. There were times, before Israeli airstrikes on Gaza shattered the two-month-old cease-fire on March 18, when Huda Abu Teir and her family could almost believe things might go back to normal. After fleeing from their home to a shelter for displaced people, and then to a tent, another shelter and on to another encampment during 15 months of war — six or seven displacements in all — they had returned to their house in Abasan al-Kabira, in southeastern Gaza, where they lived with Huda’s grandparents and uncles. Back at home a few weeks ago, Huda, 19, threw a pizza party for her cousins, said one cousin, Fatma al-Shawwaf, 20. The other girls teased Huda: Shouldn’t you be studying? Huda, who was set on becoming a nurse, always seemed to be studying. But Huda laughingly retorted that she liked having fun, too. The day before Israeliairstrikesresumed, Huda asked her Uncle Nour, who taught technology, if he could help her go over the material for her high school exams. He promised her a study session the next evening, he said. Huda Abu Teir wanted to become a nurse. But around midnight, Huda’s brother Abdullah, 15, heard an explosion. “What was that?” he screamed to his father, who had no time to answer before the next blast, this time over their heads and under their feet all at once. Abdullah was sent flying onto a neighbor’s roof, he said. Pieces of the house he had grown up in smoldered around him. He felt a sharp pain in his right eye and couldn’t see much. He could only scream: “I’m here! Can you hear me?”Startled awake by the explosions and the screaming, a cousin who lived nearby, Qasim, 35, sprinted down the street through the dark. The four-story house that Huda and Abdullah’s grandparents had built nearly three decades ago had all but collapsed, he said, the upper floors sandwiched flat atop the lower ones. Using his phone as a flashlight, Qasim stepped inside and saw Huda’s grandmother, Shawqia, 63, lying in the rubble, bleeding. She was not moving. Others who lived there had been flung outside by the force of the blast, Qasim said. Everywhere, people were bleeding from their noses or ears. Huda was one of the eight killed, along with her parents: Asmaa, 35, who had taken care of all the Abu Teirs whenever Shawqia went to Egypt for thyroid cancer treatment, and Mohammed, 42, who worked as a security officer at the Rafah border crossing for the Hamas-led government, relatives said. Huda’s cousin Anas, 13, was breathing when they found him. But an ambulance didn’t arrive for nearly an hour, Qasim said. Anas died waiting. His two younger sisters, Jana, 11, and Leen, 6, and his mother, Fulla Abu Teir, 29, were also killed. Shawqia was dead, too. Her husband, Suleiman, had died early in the war, relatives said, when his heart condition flared up after a nearby airstrike. “We never thought such massive attacks would happen again,” Qasim said two days later at the European Gaza Hospital near Khan Younis. “We thought the fighting had exhausted both sides, and that war wouldn’t start again.”The Israeli military said that it had targeted a Hamas operative who “stayed inside a building” on March 18, but did not identify the person or specify whether it meant the Abu Teirs’ home. Family members said there was no reason they would have been targeted. Gaza has resumed counting its daily dead. The Israeliairstrikes that nightkilled more than 400 people, and barrages since then have killed about 600 more, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry’s figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, though Hamas publicly announced the deaths of several senior officials in last month’s initial attacks. Israel said it had renewed airstrikes on Hamas sites and operatives to force the group to release more Israeli hostages after Hamas  rejected new Israeli demands. A New York Times investigation found that the Israeli military hasloosened its rulesaround how many civilians it can endanger with each airstrike in pursuit of Hamas fighters, who Israel says are embedded among civilians. On Wednesday, the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, announced it wouldexpand its military offensivein Gaza, adding to the threats looming over the population there. In all, Gaza health officials say,more than 50,000 peoplehave been killed since the war began in October 2023, after a Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 more captive. Israel’s response has crushedentire families, wholeneighborhoods, Gaza’shealth caresystem, its educational institutions, its infrastructure and most of itseconomy. Gaza health officials say that more than 50,000 people have been killed since the war began in October 2023. Abdullah, Huda’s 15-year-old brother, knew little of what happened that night two weeks ago. After the airstrike, he managed to push aside the broken water tank and heating panel he was trapped under before blacking out, he said two days later. He woke up in the hospital, pain singeing both eyes, his vision still blurry. Nobody had told him yet that Huda was dead, or his parents, or that his brother Maher was in intensive care. Abdullah was the third of five. His father had fallen for his mother, a cousin, when they were still teenagers. In a society where most marriages are arranged, relatives remarked on Mohammed and Asmaa’s visible tenderness toward each other, Qasim, a cousin, said. Family was everything. Mohammed always threw big birthday parties for the children. And when one of Mohammed’s sisters, also called Huda, was recovering from a C-section, Asmaa bathed and cooked for her as if she were her own sister, the sister recalled. Qasim remembered Mohammed bursting with pride when his eldest daughter, Bayan, got married. He jokingly asked Huda if she wanted to get married next, even before graduating, as some Gaza girls did. Siblings Abdullah, right, and Amira Abu Teir at the European Gaza Hospital, near Khan Younis, after they were wounded in an airstrike. Huda flew into a rage, her sister Amira remembered. She was the kind of kid who doodled “Nurse Huda in the future” in her notebooks. She loved weddings, and shopping, too — for skin care, for stylish dresses. But marriage could wait. Their grandmother was more traditional. Shawqia was the backbone of the family, dispensing home-cooked food and help whenever anyone needed it and relying on her faith for strength, her family said. Before the war, the family looked forward every year to the day beforeRamadan, when Shawqia would invite everyone over for a giant meal in the garden before they began their daily fasts for the holy month. Maftoul, a Palestinian couscous dish, was her specialty, her family recalled: No one else was allowed to make it or fiddle with the spices she put in it. When the Abu Teirs were sheltering in the southern city of Rafah early last year, Shawqia made a daily habit of visiting every son and daughter’s family in their respective tents to check in, her daughter Huda said. She sat and helped her grandchildren memorize verses of the Quran, feeding them dates and cookies. At one point during the war, the Abu Teirs took refuge with another family in central Gaza. Grateful, Shawqia’s husband, Suleiman, promised to repay them when peace returned, their son Nour said. Suleiman died shortly after. But Shawqia remembered their promise. Last month, she made several batches of maftoul and asked one of her sons to deliver them to the family who had hosted them. She was killed a week later.

A Remote Spot in Saudi Arabia That Won’t Be Remote for Long,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/travel-al-ula-saudi-arabia.html,2025-04-02T09:00:41Z,World,Hotel construction and public art projects already are changing the vast desert landscape of Al-Ula in the country’s northwest.,Travel and Vacations; Tombs and Tombstones; Hotels and Travel Lodgings; your-feed-fashion,"Nouvel, Jean",Al Ula (Saudi Arabia),,"Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, features sandstone and granite formations. Reporting from Al-Ula, Saudi ArabiaA Remote Spot in Saudi Arabia That Won’t Be Remote for LongHotel construction and public art projects already are changing the vast desert landscape of Al-Ula in the country’s northwest. Many travelers are driven by a desperate desire to reach the last great undiscovered place before the rest of the tourist hordes. In 2025, though, that elusive location is becoming something of a mirage. That is particularly apparent in Saudi Arabia, whichopened itself to tourismnearly six years ago (before, only Muslims, traveling for religious reasons, had been allowed to enter). Things now are changing so fast in the desert kingdom that there has been a Dubai-esque feeling to its warp-speed transformation. My online visa application was approved in less than three hours. I almost thought it was a hoax. Nowhere is this “get there before it’s ruined” feeling more urgent than in Al-Ula, a vast desert landscape of towering sandstone and granite rock formations in the northwest of the country that is, for now, barely untouched by time. The wind- and human-sculpted tombs chiseled into these mountains were the southernmost reaches of the Nabatean empire, which famously built Petra, some 550 kilometers, or about 340 miles, to the north, in Jordan. But Petra now offers a glimpse of what Al-Ula will no doubt become in the next 10 to 20 years: dozens, if not hundreds, of hotels; donkey rides to overcrowded ruins; and tourists vying for the perfect Instagram shot. That is, of course, if Saudi Arabia’s efforts to modify its global public image are successful. Its human rights violations, religious extremism and history of oppressing women already keep many travelers from even considering a visit. And alcohol still is banned, although there have been whispers that restriction is being reconsidered in light of the country’s role as host ofthe 2034 World Cupand as part ofSaudi Vision 2030, the country’s ambitious project to diversify its economy. Much of the rest of the kingdom has been moving forward, regardless. Riyadh, the country’s capital, and Jeddah, its major port, are both bustling modern cities, and women are now allowed to drive and travel freely around the country without a male escort, which was unthinkable even a decade ago. Villas at the Nujuma Ritz-Carlton resort. While the Red Sea coastline outside Jeddah is virtually undeveloped for more than 1,100 miles, a resort area known as theRed Sea Projecthas several new five-star resorts, including theNujuma Ritz-Carltonwith its over-the-water podlike villas. The Red Sea Airport, built in 2023, serves this area (Al-Ula has its own airport), as well as resorts farther inland, including the utterly isolated and priceySix Senses Southern Dunes, with its mirage-like views of the rolling desert as it blends into the Red Sea about 45 minutes away. And theDesert Rock resorthas villas with pools built into the sides of giant rock formations with views across seemingly endless valleys. Many of these resorts are not exactly packing in tourists yet, but they clearly are ready. The central canopy at the Six Senses Southern Dunes resort. For now, however, Al-Ula might as well be on Mars. It’s far less developed than anything I have seen in the most remote parts of the Middle East, including the rugged mountainous villages of Oman, which now offer five-star resorts and hiking tours. The region is 22,550 square kilometers, or 8,700 square miles, though most of the111 tombsare packed into an area of about six square kilometers. Here, there are glamping sites under glittering stars at night, and morning treks to the massive tombs where only a dozen or so other visitors may have gathered. Travel Weekly magazinerecently described the rock formations: “A gigantic elephant glows enchantingly at dusk, a guitar takes shape in the narrow crevice between two mountain peaks, a bowling pin juts over a sandstone outcrop.”The area has had a bit of a spooky reputation, though. Many Muslims consider it to be cursed since the Thamud people of the region, who flourished there from as early as the eighth century B.C., were later denounced by the Prophet Muhammad as “wrongdoers.” The fact that Muslims have avoided the area for centuries, many local tour guides say, is exactly why it is so well preserved and seemingly trapped in time. TheNabateanswere a nomadic Arab tribe that flourished for centuries before being conquered by theRomans in the second centuryA.D. — and the nearby region, called Hegra, is where they carved huge tombs into the sides of enormous rocks. One of the most famous is the so-calledLonely Castle, or Qasr al-Farid, a meticulously sculpted facade of four columns that is a dramatic entrance to a 72-foot-high boulder. Coming to the site offers a glimpse of what visiting Egypt might have felt like when the Western world was first learning about the buried treasures of an ancient kingdom. While Al-Ula offers a glimpse into a mysterious past, it already is focusing on the future. It has become an arts destination, with several galleries and public art spaces. A massive public art project of site-specific art and open-air sculptures is being created,scheduled to open sometime after 2027. It coincides with many celebrity architect-designed resorts in the works, including Sharaan by the French architect Jean Nouvel,which is being built into the side of a mountain. The current offerings of glamping — let’s just call them luxury hotels with a tentlike appearance and swimming pools that cozy up to the giant rocks around them — include theBanyan TreeandOur Habitas. The Banyan Tree resort in Al-Ula. I stayed two nights at Our Habitas, which also offers what it calls a more “rustic” experience in luxuriously appointedAirstream travel trailersthat are parked even farther into the sprawling valleys for that true sense of getting away from your fellow tourists. All of these glamping sites are nestled among the boulders and the thin, dry air that seems to hold the silence naturally. An early morning “run” to the rock formations, which is standard before the heat of the day sets in (temperatures from May to October can reach 40 Celsius, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), sort of reclaims that old safari term. Morning runs in Africa have morphed into traffic jams of all-terrain vehicles trying to get close to a lion or giraffe. Here, there is a sense of being a charter member of the Al-Ula Tourism Club. No tacky trinket shops, no groups of tourists flocking to get photos. Just a stillness among the Nabatean tombs as the morning light turns the beige rocks ever-shifting shades of orange. And there is nothing more refreshing than tomblike silence when discovering what  could be the last great unexplored tourist spot just waiting to be developed.

Reporting from TokyoAlready Seen Kyoto? Expand Your Itinerary in JapanEveryone goes to Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Why not try spots like the bustling port of Yokohama or the serene monasteries of Koyasan instead? A decade ago, many travelers considered Japan too expensive for a vacation. What a difference a weak yen has made — suddenly, it seems likeeverybodyis here. Numbers from the Japan National Tourism Organization support that feeling: The country had a record-breaking 36.9 million international visitors in 2024, a 47 percent increase from the previous year. But a lot of tourists stick to the well-trodden path of Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. And while it is hard to blame anyone for wanting to see the neon lights of Tokyo’s Shinjuku neighborhood or the Arashiyama bamboo forest in Kyoto, they do miss out on other (perhaps even better) locations. Andrew Faulk, a Tokyo resident, has been a freelance photographer here for 10 years, often working for The New York Times. “Traveling beyond the typical hot spots,” he said, “allows visitors to experience Japan’s true spirit — its culture, landscapes and unique traditions.”So here are some of his recommendations, accompanied by photographs he has taken over the years: YokohamaSojiji Temple in Yokohama, Japan. Yokohama is just another big city, like Tokyo — right? Actually Japan’s second most populous city has a few distinctions of its own: As one of the country’s first ports to open to foreign trade in the 1800s, it has retained an international flair. And it boasts a vibrant Chinatown neighborhood. Yet “unlike the fast-paced hustle and packed streets of Tokyo,” Faulk says, “Yokohama feels more relaxed.” He particularly recommends visiting Yamashita Park, to watch ships passing the Yokohama Bay Bridge, and strolling through the crowded back streets of the Noge district, which is filled with small bars, cafes and jazz clubs. YamaguchiThe Ryufukuji Temple in Yamaguchi, Japan. For anyone craving Kyoto’s traditional vibes, Yamaguchi exudes a similar atmosphere, but without the crowds. The city, at the western tip of Japan’s main island of Honshu, packs a lot of historical sights, including the Hagi Castle Town, a district with preserved samurai houses and walled roads. It is no surprise that the city showed up in The Times’52 Places to Go To in 2024. Faulk recommends the Sesshu Garden at Jyoei Temple: “The carefully placed rocks, flowing water and meticulously trimmed trees all come together to create a centralized harmony.”Yamanaka OnsenThe Kakusenkei Gorge in Yamanaka, Japan. Nestled in the mountains of the Kaga region on Honshu, Yamanaka Onsen is a small town with a thousand years of history, particularly linked to the art of geisha and lacquerware. “Although it can still feel a bit touristy, Yamanaka Onsen is a hot-spring town that offers a balance of relaxation and traditional culture,” Faulk says. He particularly enjoys the trails in the Kakusenkei Gorge, saying that the winding paths feel like something out ofa Studio Ghibli film: “The air is refreshing, filled with the scent of pine.”FukuokaOne of the food stands in Fukuoka, Japan. There is a lot to love about Fukuoka, on the northern shore of Kyushu island: For one, the yatai, or open-air food stalls that at night serve bowls of the Hakata ramen (thin noodles in a soup made from pork bones) or skewers of grilled chicken. Faulk’s choice is that local ramen: “The thin, straight noodles complement the creamy tonkotsu broth beautifully. They offer a satisfying chew that pair nicely with each slurp.”KoyasanAt the Garan Temple complex in Koyasan, Japan. Koyasan, a two-hour drive south of Osaka, is synonymous with temple stays because the Buddhist monks who live in its more than 100 monasteries welcome visitors. “Koyasan offers a serenity that stands in extreme contrast to metropolitan Japan,” Faulk says. He recommends visiting the Okunoin Temple cemetery, and walking the stone path flanked by tall cedars. Its graves, blanketed with moss and roots, are reminders of the area’s spiritual significance, he says — especially the mausoleum of Kobo Daishi, an eighth century monk also known as Kukai, who was a poet, calligrapher and the founder of a Buddhist sect.

Angola Rail Line Offers Clues to Trump’s Africa Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/africa/trump-angola-lobito-corridor.html,2025-04-02T07:01:10Z,World,"The $4 billion project was the Biden administration’s signature initiative in Africa.

Biden Jr. discussed the Lobito Corridor railway project with African leaders in Angola in December. President João Lourenço of Angola was sitting to Mr. Biden’s left. Reporting from JohannesburgAngola Rail Line Offers Clues to Trump’s Africa PolicyThe $4 billion project was the Biden administration’s signature initiative in Africa. Early signs are that the Trump team supports it, too, for mineral access if nothing else. An 800-mile rail corridor stretching from Angola’s northern border to the Atlantic Ocean was former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature project in Africa, meant to counter Chinese influence and reshape America’s engagement with the continent. When President Trump came into office this year, he quickly moved to dismantle decades of American aid to Africa, raising fears that the United States was pulling back from its commitments. The future of America’s involvement in the rail project was an open question. But this week, the acting U.S. ambassador in Angola, James Story, gave the first indication that the Trump administration was on board with the project, the Lobito Corridor, which is expected to improve America’s access to minerals like cobalt and copper that are critical to the clean-energy transition. Mr. Story, who arrived in Angola last October, is leading a delegation of more than a dozen, mostly Western envoys on a three-day publicity tour along the rail line, including visits with local politicians. As Mr. Trump continues to craft his own Africa team, the tour offered clues to how he plans to shape his policy on the continent, and the ways in which it may align with or depart from Mr. Biden’s approach. “The Trump administration is all about making business to favor the United States,” said Osvaldo Mboco, a professor of international relations at the Technical University of Angola in the capital, Luanda. Although no Trump officials from Washington came on the tour, Mr. Story said the administration supported the effort. The purpose, he added, was to show international solidarity, look for investment opportunities and make clear that the United States and its Western allies are not walking away from the project. The railway was initially completed in 1931, running from Angola’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo — home to the world’s largest cobalt reserves — to the port city of Lobito on the west coast. China funded the rehabilitation of the line a little more than a decade ago. Under the Biden administration, the United States committed about $4 billion to various projects along the corridor, including refurbishing the rail line, and developing mining and agricultural projects. A solar plant near Lobito, Angola, that was funded by the United States. The Lobito Corridor is a railway system that connects Angola with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. Mr. Biden pitched the corridor as part of America’s new approach to engaging with Africa — focusing more on commercial partnerships, rather than just aid and extracting natural resources. He saw it as an answer to China’s longtime engagement with African nations, which has resulted in the construction of new cities, airports, highways and shopping centers. Biden administration officials said the railway would entice companies to build manufacturing plants nearby so they could transport goods, and would give local farmers a way to ship their produce. It is unclear if the Trump administration will champion those broader economic benefits of the rail line or focus squarely on increasing American access to minerals. “Is this just about the refurbishment of a rail or is it about investing in telecoms and alternative energy sources and food security,” said Judd Devermont, who was one of Mr. Biden’s top advisers on Africa. The project’s ambitions already have been affected by some of Mr. Trump’s policies. An initiative meant to teach women better farming techniques, with the hope of increasing agricultural production along the rail line, was shut down after Mr. Trump defunded the United States Agency for International Development. There are some early indications, however, that the Trump administration might be looking for business investments in Africa. Ben Black, the president’s nominee to run the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, which lends billions to overseas projects and has been one of America’s main funders along the Lobito Corridor, has said he wants to take an “investment-driven” approach to overseas spending. Adam Cortese, the chief executive of Sun Africa, an American solar energy company with U.S. government-backed projects along the corridor and in Nigeria, said his engagements with Trump officials had been encouraging. The officials have expressed a desire to invest in developing Africa’s energy infrastructure, he said. “They support production as long as it has to do with U.S. companies,” he said, adding that his company’s primary competitors in Africa are Chinese state-owned entities. “There certainly seems to be a lot of support for increasing U.S. competition with China.”Although Mr. Trump has not explicitly expressed support for the Lobito Corridor project, Ricardo Viegas D’Abreu, Angola’s transportation minister, said this week’s diplomatic mission was a positive signal. Angola’s president has said that strengthening economic ties with the United States is essential to help his oil-rich country grow and diversify its economy. “We feel that no major disruption has happened even on the transition to this new administration,” Mr. D’Abreu said of the progress on the Lobito project. Ultimately, the benefit that Angola and other African nations get from doing business with Mr. Trump will come down to how those countries position themselves, said Mr. Mboco, the international relations professor. They will need to strike deals that include U.S. investment in manufacturing in Africa, rather than allowing Americans to just extract natural resources, he said. “Africa needs to stop being the poor family member,” Mr. Mboco said.

Myanmar Military Declares Temporary Truce After Earthquake,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/world/asia/myanmar-quake-aid.html,2025-04-02T04:26:56Z,World,"It was unclear whether the cease-fire would be honored.

Reporting from BangkokMyanmar Military Declares Temporary Truce After EarthquakeIt was unclear whether the cease-fire would be honored. It came a day after soldiers fired at a Chinese Red Cross aid convoy, and amid multiple airstrikes. Myanmar’s military on Wednesday declared a 21-day cease-fire to support relief and reconstruction efforts in the wake of a devastating earthquake in the country, a day after it fired on a Chinese Red Cross convoy trying to deliver food and medicine to desperate survivors. The attack on the Chinese convoy, which was widely condemned by rights activists, highlighted the dangers aid groups face from the country’s ongoing civil war. It remains unclear whether the cease-fire would be honored — armed rebel groups said the military had launched scores of airstrikes since Friday’s 7.7-magnitudetemblor, which killed at least 2,700. In the wake of the earthquake, the shadow government in exile, known as the National Unity Government, and an alliance of three rebel groups announced cease-fires. But the military, which seized power in a coup four years ago, had indicated that it would not stop hostilities. The fierce civil war had already caused widespread suffering before the earthquake, which left millions of people with little food and water. On Wednesday, the office of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the chief of Myanmar’s junta, said the temporary cease-fire would run from April 2 to April 22. It was declared “to express sympathy for affected citizens, facilitate humanitarian aid and ensure stability during the recovery period.”But a day before, he had said that military operations would continue as “necessary protective measures” despite the earthquake. “There’s nothing necessary nor protective about attacking people trying to help people,” said Tom Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar. “Continuing to launch military offenses is just outrageous.”On Tuesday around 9:30 p.m., the military fired at the Chinese Red Cross convoy near Ummati village in northern Shan State after the convoy had failed to notify them of its presence in advance, according to Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesman for Myanmar’s military. An armed rebel group, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, which was part of the rebel alliance that declared a one-month cease-fire, said that the convoy had been traveling toward the central city of Mandalay, near the epicenter of the earthquake. Gen. Zaw Min Tun said that when the convoy was spotted, soldiers tried to block its path but it did not stop. Flashlights were used to signal it from about 100 to 200 yards away, but it continued moving. At around 100 yards, soldiers fired shots into the air three times. “Since this region is an active conflict zone with ongoing battles between the Ta’ang National Liberation Army  and the military, failure to notify could have led to misidentification as a hostile entity,” Gen. Zaw Min Tun said. A partially collapsed building in Mandalay on Wednesday. The Red Cross Society of China did not respond to requests for comment. China, which has close relations with Myanmar, was one of the first countries to respond to the earthquake, deploying search-and-rescue teams and sending about $14 million in emergency aid. At least 15 countries, including the United States and Russia, have sent aid. In recent days, international aid groups such as the World Food Program and UNICEF have entered Mandalay and neighboring Sagaing. But Taiwan has said its offer of a 126-member rescue team was declined by Myanmar. Tayzar San, a pro-democracy activist from Mandalay, accused the military junta of “trying to use this disaster for political gain” instead of focusing on “effective rescue efforts.”Local residents in both cities have complained that attempts to help have been blocked by the military. Ko Thein Swe said he and his charity group had traveled from Thaton in Mon state with food and medicine and seeking to help search and rescue missions. But while en route to Mandalay on Sunday, they were told at a military checkpoint that they could not proceed without permission and were only able to pass through by paying the soldiers. “At a time when so many people are suffering, not only do they refuse to help, but they don’t even have the basic human decency to let others assist,” Mr. Thein Swe said. Myanmar has been at war since the army seized power in a coup in 2021. The junta, which controls the urban areas, has lost large swaths of land to the powerful ethnic armies on the borders, and parts of the region of Sagaing to ordinary citizens who took up arms against the junta.

Mr. Tayzar, the activist, said the army had launched over 100 airstrikes in the past week, including in earthquake-affected areas, citing contacts on the ground. On Tuesday around 5:30 p.m., 38 young trainees of the Kachin Independence Army, an armed group battling the military in northern Myanmar, were killed in an airstrike in Kachin State, according to Colonel Naw Bu, the spokesman of the group.

China’s New Barges Could Make a Tough Task Easier: Invading Taiwan,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-invasion-barges-taiwan.html,2025-04-02T03:20:18Z,World,"The barges, which link up to form a bridge, could give China a way to land large numbers of vehicles and troops on Taiwan, solving a major logistical problem.",Defense and Military Forces; Ships and Shipping,Xi Jinping,China; Guangzhou (China); Taiwan; Taiwan Strait,People's Liberation Army (China)," China’s New Barges Could Make a Tough Task Easier: Invading TaiwanThe barges, which link up to form a bridge, could give China a way to land large numbers of vehicles and troops on Taiwan, solving a major logistical problem. In recent weeks, China has been practicing unusual maneuvers off its southern coast involving three special barges. The vessels have linked up one behind another, forming a long bridge that extends from deeper waters onto the beach. That feat has been a warning to Taiwan. The vessels’ debut suggests that China’s People’s Liberation Army may be a step closer to being able to land tens of thousands of troops and their weapons and vehicles on Taiwan’s shores, experts say. Developing that capability has been a priority of China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in his quest to absorb Taiwan — either by negotiations or by war. China has been conducting military exercises around Taiwan for years, includinga new surgethis week. But even as China’s drills have intensified, and its missiles, warships and fighter jets have advanced, many experts have doubted that the Chinese military could cross the Taiwan Strait with the speed and numbers needed for a successful invasion. Strong winds and currents for much of the year add to the dangers of trying to land on Taiwan. If the new barges go into service, they could expand China’s options for where and when to land on Taiwan, making Mr. Xi’s threat of a possible invasion more plausible. The vessels have been practicing in waters about 220 miles southwest of Guangzhou, the city where they were built. The barges have retractable, heavy-duty legs that work like giant stilts. The legs protrude from the deck when in transit and are lowered, when the vessels are in position, onto the seabed to steady the vessels against the waves. The barges then thrust out long extendable bridges, forming a 2,700-foot causeway that links the vessels together and connects to the shore. Pictures from foreign satellites have shown the barges practicing with civilian Chinese cargo ships and ferries that could carry vehicles and people to be offloaded onto the causeway. China featured the barges ona recent program about military rivalrywith Taiwan, warning that they could play a potential role in an attack. “This equipment is a bridge and a port combined into one,” Wei Dongxu, a CCTV commentator on the show, said of the barges. Once China gains dominance in the skies and seas, he said, ships loaded with military vehicles could dock with the barges and unload the vehicles, enabling heavy combat equipment to land without touching the water. He said of the barges: “Once they appear, that means that the landing has scored a major victory.”Some American commanders andofficialshave said that Mr. Xi has ordered the People’s Liberation Army to be able to take Taiwan by 2027. Mr. Xi has not said that China would definitely invade Taiwan, and there is debate about Beijing’s intentions, urgency and capabilities. Crossing the Taiwan Strait could be perilous for China’s forces, even with more options for getting ashore. The United States could send forces to help Taiwan against China, raising the risk of war between two nuclear powers. Before any attempt by China to land in large numbers — possibly with the barges — the first wave of invading troops could face fierce fighting in the strait and on Taiwan. But the three landing barges showed that China’s armed forces were rapidly developing ways to get over logistical hurdles of a possible invasion, said J. Michael Dahm, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer andco-author of a studyof the new barges. The barges work in sets of three — the longest barge, at 607 feet long, the shortest, 361 feet. The vessels’ legs, when lowered, pin the barges in place and can push the hulls up and above the water, for stability. Each barge also has a tower at the front, which can telescope out a bridge, connecting it to the next barge or to the shore. The barges form a pier onto which ships that line up alongside the barges could disgorge vehicles. The vehicles could then drive directly along the pier to the shore. Mr. Dahm said that he used to doubt that the Chinese military would meet Mr. Xi’s goal of readiness by 2027. “I will tell you my mind has really been changed over just the last 12 to 18 months, seeing the scale of infrastructure and capability improvements that the Chinese have made,” such as the landing barges, he said. The barges first came to public attention early this year, afterH.I. Sutton, a defense analyst,reported that they were being builtin a shipyard in Guangzhou. A large landing barge under construction in January. The same barge, out of the dry dock, and a smaller one in the same shipyard in March. The Times analyzed satellite imagery andmarine traffic datathat showed that several commercial ferries and cargo ships took part in the exercises. The commercial ships sidled up to the two larger barges farthest from shore, apparently practicing how to get in place to offload vehicles. The satellite images did not show any vehicles actually being unloaded. But ferries and cargo ships that took part were of a kind built or modified to handle heavy armed vehicles, like armored personnel vehicles or even tanks, said Jason Wang, the chief operating officer ofingeniSPACE, a company that analyzes satellite images and other data, including about the Chinese military. Taiwan’s western coastline, facing the Chinese mainland, has relatively few beaches or ports where landing is easy, and those areas are relatively well guarded. The barges would theoretically enable China to pick other areas on Taiwan’s coast that might be more difficult to land on but are less defended, from which to come ashore, several experts said. “These barges will open up new locations to deliver troops and material for Xi Jinping to choose from” along Taiwan’s coast, Mr. Wang said. He estimated that in one day the barges could offload hundreds of armored vehicles. “China still doesn’t have enough gray hull naval ships to assault Taiwan’s main island on their own,” Mr. Wang said, referring to the typical color of warships. But when you add specialized dual-use ferries and cargo ships, “then that becomes a different story,” he said. “You’re then starting to have enough vessels to be able to deliver a battalion on shore quickly,” he said. Chinese military planners have closely studied previous wars involving amphibious landings, including Britain’s war to retake the Falkland Islands in 1982, and the D-Day landings at Normandy in 1944. China may be some way from having a surefire solution to landing on Taiwan. The People’s Liberation Army seems likely to further test the new barges in larger military drills, possibly later this year, saidChieh Chung, a researcher at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a government-funded group in Taipei. “They usually carry out testing through exercises before officially entering into mass production,” he said of China’s military. “Their direction is set — how to overcome all the difficulties that could trouble a joint landing operation.”During the recent practice runs, it took several hours for the transport ships to dock at the mobile pier, even with help from tugboats. On March 25, one ship appeared to abandon its effort to dock at the pier where two other ships were already berthed. It succeeded the next day and was joined by a small tanker used to refuel the self-propelled barges, making for a total of four ships moored at the same time — a first for the formation. Mr. Wang, the expert on satellite image analysis, said that at the shipyard in Guangzhou that built the new barges, another set of three was nearly finished and had entered the water for initial tests.

Betty Webb, Who Helped Bletchley Park Code Breakers, Dies at 101Sworn to secrecy about the goings-on at Britain’s storied World War II decryption operation, she only later recounted the efforts to crack German signals. Betty Webb, who as a young woman during World War II helped code breakers decipher enemy signals at Britain’s top-secretBletchley Park, died on Monday.  One of the last surviving members of that group, she was 101. Her death wasconfirmedby the Women’s Royal Army Corps Association and by the Bletchley Park Trust. Ms. Webb, whose given name was Charlotte, was 18 when she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women’s branch of the British Army, and was assigned to work at its decryption base at Bletchley Park, a 19th-century mansion and estate in Buckinghamshire about 50 miles northwest of London. She helped in the decoding of German messages from 1941 to 1945 and also worked on Japanese signals. In 2015, Ms. Webb was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and in 2021 she was awarded the Légion d’Honneur, France’s most prestigious honor. She was one of a handful of young women working at Bletchley, where mathematicians, cryptographers and code breakers endeavored to crack encrypted messages and gather information about the Axis powers. She had been studying domestic sciences at a local college, but as war swept across Europe, she dropped out. “Several of us decided that we ought to be serving our country rather than just making sausage rolls,” she recalled for anoral historyin 2012. With German submarines on the hunt for Allied vessels in the Atlantic Ocean, the work of the cryptologists at Bletchley Park was critical to the Allied war effort. With the enemy messages decoded, Allied ships could change course and avoid peril. Like others working at the site, Ms. Webb was bound by Britain’s strict Official Secrets Act, meaning she could not discuss her work with family members, friends or even others working at Bletchley. Code breaking at Bletchley Park in 1943. The level of secrecy was such, she said, that she knew only vaguely how her role fit into the greater scheme of intelligence gathering. She was unable to tie anything she saw to specific events during the war. It was not until much later that she understood her part in the bigger picture. At war’s end, she began looking for another job, but was hampered by her inability to tell employers just what she had been doing for the past few years. By a stroke of good fortune, one of the people she interviewed with was the headmaster of Ludlow Grammar School, a fellow Bletchley Park alum. “He gave me a job without questions,” Ms. Webb said, though the two never spoke to each other about their wartime efforts, she added. She worked at the school as a secretary. In the mid-1970s, some of the work done at Bletchley Park began to bedeclassified, but Ms. Webb said she did not openly discuss her experience until the 1990s, when she was asked if she could give talks about it. “I suddenly realized that, yes, I could, I’m free, I don’t have to worry any more,” she said in the oral history. “But I was never able to tell my parents, as they died before 1975, and my husband wasn’t particularly interested.”She soon began increasing her efforts to record for posterity the work done by the code breakers, including publishing abook, “No More Secrets.”In the book, Ms. Webb offers glimpses into her work and describes her upbringing, including the time she spent in Nazi Germany as a child before the war. She recounted a small act of defiance, in which, she said, she refused to give a verbal Nazi salute beside her classmates. Charlotte Vine-Stevens was born on May 13, 1923, in Aston on Clun, in Shropshire, in the West Midlands. No information on survivors was available. Ina tributeon Tuesday, the Women’s Royal Army Corps Association said, “Betty inspired women in the Army for decades, and we will continue to take pride in her service during WWII and beyond, and as a champion of female veterans.”"

Fourth U.S. Soldier Is Found Dead in LithuaniaThe soldier and three others had gone on a training mission in a 70-ton vehicle that sank in a bog near the border with Belarus. The body of a fourth U.S. Army soldier was found on Tuesday in Lithuania, a week after the soldier and three others were reported missing when the armored vehicle they were riding in sank in a bog, the U.S. military said. The body was found a day after the three other soldiers were found dead following an extensive international search effort that involved hundreds of personnel from Lithuania, the United States, Poland and Estonia. The four U.S. soldiers, from the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, were reported missing early on March 25, when they did not return from a training mission in an M88A2 Hercules, a 70-ton vehicle that is essentially a giant military tow truck. Sgt. Edvin F. Franco, 25, of Glendale, Calif. They had been sent out to extract another Army vehicle, the military said. But the soldiers may have driven off the road and into a deep bog, and they appeared to have been trapped inside as the vehicle sank, according to an Army official in Europe. The U.S. Army is investigating the cause of the accident. Rescue workers located the vehicle on March 26, but extracting it from the mud proved to be a daunting engineering challenge. Heavy equipment was brought in to dredge the bog, and divers, dogs and drones — including one equipped with ground-penetrating radar — were deployed in the recovery effort. The U.S. Army did not announce where the body of the fourth soldier had been found although a senior U.S. Army official in Europe said it was recovered near the M88. The soldiers had been training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus. The Army identified the three soldiers whose bodies were found on Monday as Sgt. Jose Duenez, Jr., 25, of Joliet, Ill.,; Sgt. Edvin F. Franco, 25, of Glendale, Calif.; and Pfc. Dante D. Taitano, 21, of Dededo, Guam. All three were M1 Abrams tank system maintainers. The fourth soldier whose body was found on Tuesday was identified as Staff Sgt. Troy S. Knutson-Collins, 28, of Battle Creek, Mich. He was an artillery mechanic. Staff Sgt. Troy S. Knutson-Collins, of Battle Creek, Mich. “This loss is simply devastating,” Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, the commanding general of the Third Infantry Division, said in a statement. “These men were honored soldiers of the Marne Division. We are wrapping our arms around the families and loved ones of our soldiers.”Sergeant Duenez had been in the Army for more than seven years and had previously served in Poland and in Germany. Sergeant Franco had served in the Army for over six years, and had previously deployed to Korea and Germany. Private Taitano had served in the Army for nearly two years and had arrived at Fort Stewart in Georgia, the home of the Third Infantry Division, in October 2023. Sergeant Knutson-Collins served for more than seven years in the Army, and deployed to Korea in 2020. Sgt. Jose Duenez, Jr., 25, of Joliet, Ill.,American military leaders praised the Lithuanians and others who helped search for the soldiers. “I can’t say enough about the support our Lithuanian allies have provided us,” Gen. Christopher Donahue, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa,said in a statement. “We have leaned on them, and they, alongside our Polish and Estonian allies — and our own sailors, airmen and experts from the Corps of Engineers — have enabled us to find and bring home our soldiers.”Pfc. Dante D. Taitano, 21, of Dededo, GuamLithuanian leaders have pointed to the international recovery effort to underscore the value of NATO allies working together amid rising alarm in Lithuania and other Baltic countries that President Trump will weaken the NATO alliance. On Tuesday, President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, who had visited the site of the accident, said the country’s “heartfelt condolences go to our U.S. allies and their people.”“Lithuania has been praying for all four missing soldiers, and now, with all our hearts, we stand with their families,” hesaid on social media. “We are deeply grateful to everyone who dedicated immense efforts to find the one remaining soldier still missing under such challenging conditions.”Eric Schmittcontributed reporting.

Vivian Yee reported from Cairo, and Farnaz Fassihi from the United Nations. U.N. Accuses Israel of Killing 15 Rescue Workers in GazaThe United Nations said Israeli forces killed the people as they were trying to aid injured civilians, then buried them in a mass grave. Israel said nine of the 15 dead were Palestinian militants. As Israeli forces advanced on the southern Gaza city of Rafah before dawn last Sunday, an ambulance crew set out to evacuate civilians wounded by Israeli shelling. But the ambulance and its crew were hit on the way. Several more ambulances and a fire truck headed to the scene over the next few hours to rescue them, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, as did a U.N. vehicle, the United Nations said. Seventeen people were dispatched in total. Then they all went silent. It took five days for the United Nations and Red Crescent to negotiate with the Israeli military for safe passage to search for the missing people. After receiving clearance, U.N. officials said, the retrieval team found 15 dead, most of their bodies dumped in a mass grave. On Sunday, the United Nations said Israel had killed them — a rare accusation by the organization, which is typically cautious about assigning clear blame. “They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives,” the U.N. humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher,said on X. “We demand answers & justice.”The Red Crescent, the International Committee of theRed Crossand the United Nations said all of those killed were humanitarian workers who should never have come under attack. The Red Crescent called the killings a war crime and demanded accountability. An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani,on Monday that nine of those killed were Palestinian militants. He said Israeli forces “did not randomly attack” an ambulance, but that several vehicles “were identified advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals toward Israeli troops, prompting them to shoot. U.N. officials said the vehicles were clearly marked as rescue vehicles. Colonel Shoshani said that during the attack, Israeli forces killed a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. He said Israeli forces had also killed eight other operatives from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group. He accused militants of “once again exploiting medical facilities and equipment for their activities.”He did not directly say whether the militants were in the emergency vehicles or address the identities of the other six people killed. After firing on the vehicles, U.N. officials said, Israeli forces bulldozed and crushed the ambulances, a fire truck and the U.N. vehicle. The Red Crescent said one medic was still missing. The lone survivor, a Red Crescent worker, was detained, beaten and released by Israeli forces the same day, according to the aid group. He told colleagues that Israeli forces had killed both of the other crew members in his ambulance, the Red Crescent and U.N. officials said. Of the 17 people involved, 10 were Red Crescent workers, six were emergency responders from Gaza’s civil defense and one was a U.N. worker, U.N. officials said. The top U.N. humanitarian official in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, joined the retrieval team andposted photoson X showing the crumpled vehicles — husks of mangled metal jutting from the sand. The large navy-blue “N” on the U.N. vehicle was still visible on it. “One by one, they were hit, they were struck. Their bodies were gathered and buried in this mass grave,” he said in a video message shared by the United Nations. Mourners following the convoy carrying the bodies of members of the Red Crescent, as they were transported for burial, in Deir al Balah, Gaza, on Monday. Days after they went missing, the U.N. team looking for them witnessed new scenes of chaos and violence in Rafah, including “hundreds of civilians fleeing under gunfire,” Mr. Whittall. One woman was shot in the back of the head, he said. He posted a video showing what he said came next: Two men walked toward the road, apparently to retrieve the woman’s body. Then one of them was shot, too. Mr. Whittall did not say who fired the shots. On Thursday, the U.N. convoy found the crumpled vehicles, U.N. officials said. Hours of digging yielded one body, a civil defense worker buried beneath his firetruck, Mr. Whittall said. They returned for the remaining bodies on Sunday. Mr. Whittall narrated the search for the bodies in the video message. “We’re digging them out in their uniforms, with their gloves on,” he said. “They were here to save lives. Instead, they ended up in a mass grave.”The grave, he said, was marked with the emergency light from one of the destroyed ambulances. Colonel Shoshani, the Israeli military spokesman, said the vehicles, unlike others along the same route earlier that day, had not received permission from Israeli forces to be there. Nebal Farsakh, a Palestine Red Crescent Society spokeswoman, said that when the ambulances set out around 3:30 a.m. on March 23, Israeli forces had not yet closed off the area as a “red zone,” where ambulances must clear their movements with Israel. Israel did not immediately address the accusations of burying people in mass graves or crushing their vehicles. In all, the Red Crescent said, 27 of its medicshave been killedsince the war began.

‘I Am Disgusted’: Le Pen Voters Voice Outrage Over Her Conviction,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/europe/le-pen-voters-outrage-conviction.html,2025-04-01T16:03:54Z,World,National Rally supporters say the court decision punishing France’s far-right leader for embezzlement will ultimately redound in her favor.,"Right-Wing Extremism and Alt-Right; Decisions and Verdicts; Demonstrations, Protests and Riots; Embezzlement; Politics and Government; Law and Legislation; Legislatures and Parliaments; Elections","Briois, Steeve; Le Pen, Marine",Henin-Beaumont (France); France,European Parliament; National Rally (France),"Some of Marine Le Pen’s constituents watch her responding to her conviction for embezzlement, in Café de la Paix, Hénin-Beaumont, France on Monday. Reporting from Hénin-Beaumont, France‘I Am Disgusted’: Le Pen Voters Voice Outrage Over Her ConvictionNational Rally supporters say the court decision punishing France’s far-right leader for embezzlement will ultimately redound in her favor. When the verdict from a Paris criminal court flashed across screens in Hénin-Beaumont, many customers in the Café de la Paix received it with the outrage and disappointment Marine Le Pen predicted. The far-right political leader wasfound guilty of embezzlement, sentenced to four years in prison — two years suspended, two in a form of house arrest — and fined more than $100,000. But most stinging was the decision barring her from running for public office for five years, rendering her ineligible to run in France’s 2027 presidential election. For people here, Ms. Le Pen is not just the leader of the National Rally, and three-time presidential candidate. She is their local lawmaker in the lower house of Parliament. “I am disgusted,” said Jean-Marc Sergheraert, 70, a retired charity manager, craning up at a big television screen. There, Ms. Le Pen was denouncing the decision as politically motivated and unjust because, she said, her sentence would be enforced even as she appealed it, which is often not the case in France. “I am disgusted,” said Jean-Marc Sergheraert, 70, a retired charity manager. “She is right,” added Mr. Sergheraert. “She must defend herself and go right to the end. If they want us to take the Capitol like they did in Washington, I will go to the Élysée,” he said, referring to the presidential palace in Paris. Nearby, Arlette Banderlique, 86, concurred over her flute of light beer. “Forbidding French to do something just pushes us more to do it,” she said. “She will get millions more votes.”Ms. Le Pen said she would appeal the ruling, though it would be difficult to resolve her challenge in time for 2027. She was convicted of diverting European Parliament funds to her party. “This decision should disgust everyone. It’s totally arbitrary,” said Steeve Briois, the National Rally mayor of Hénin-Beaumont, handing out fliers encouraging locals to stand up, peacefully, against “those who would circumvent democracy.”“This decision should disgust everyone. It’s totally arbitrary,” said Steeve Briois, the National Rally mayor of Hénin-Beaumont. If any place in France would shake with fury over the ruling, it would be Hénin-Beaumont, a town of 26,000 in France’s northern former industrial heartland, ravaged first by coal mines closing in the 1980s and then by many factories closing, victims of globalization. The unemployment rate in the area was more than double the national average in 2021, the last census. Considering this “forgotten territory,” Ms. Le Pen’s party has made this one of its strongholds.  Though she has never lived in the region, Ms. Le Pen chose it as her political heartland, running first in 1998, and continuing to represent the area in regional and European politics. In 2017, she successfully campaigned for a seat in the National Assembly. During the last presidential election in 2022, she garnered 67 percent of the local vote. In legislative elections last summer, many locally expected her party to win in a landslide, and run the government. Instead, a left-wing coalition and President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling partyformed a “dam”by asking candidates in runoffs around the country to form a single anti-National Rally vote. If any place in France would shake with fury over the ruling, it would be Hénin-Beaumont, a town of 26,000 set in France’s northern former industrial heartland. Still, in Hénin-Beaumont Ms. Le Pen won re-election in the first round by a large margin. “They want to eliminate her from the presidency,” said Karen Huret, 57, arriving Tuesday morning to the market to pick up supplies for her elderly mother. “Last time, they used the dam. This is another tactic.”For many locals, fidelity to Ms. Le Pen’s party is less about ideology than an appreciation of her party’s retail politics. They cite the new aquatic center in town and the Christmas market. They feel respected by her and the party. “She is nice. I took photos of her with my kids at the flea market,” said Ms. Huret, a stay-at-home mom. “I don’t believe she is racist. I’m from the inner-city — I believe everyone should be respected.”The town had a history of corruption preceding Ms. Le Pen’s conviction. The Socialist former mayor, Gérard Dalongeville, was convicted of stealing 4 million euros with phony invoices and sentenced to four years in prison. For some locals, the latest court ruling deepened their cynicism. “We’ve had Communists, Socialists, the National Rally — they are all the same,” said Mohamed Oussedrat, 60, enjoying a diabolo menthe at a bar, after his shift working maintenance at a hospital. Politicians and Le Pen supporters hold her fliers as they visit the morning market with the mayor of Hénin-Beaumont, Steeve Briois on Tuesday. Marine Tondelier, an elected councilor in Hénin-Beaumont and leader of the national Green Party took to the news channels to point out that the National Rally calls for strict law enforcement and tougher sentences — except, it seemed, when it came to its own members. “It shows you their hypocrisy,” she said. “I’ve been hearing about ‘systems put in place against them.’ The only system put in place is the one they set to divert public funds.”She was not the only one in town who thought that way — though perhaps in a more quiet tone. “She denigrates foreigners all the time. She says they don’t respect the law,” said Karim Zoui, 29. “Well, there you go. She doesn’t respect the law.”Then he used a term often applied by the far right to migrants —voyou, or thug. “If they are thugs,” he said, “they should pay.”National Rally posters in the marketplace on Tuesday morning.

Why Italy Made It Harder to Become Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/europe/italy-citizenship-rules.html,2025-04-01T15:41:47Z,World,The government says it tightened citizenship rules because of a deluge of applications from the descendants of emigrants who only coveted an Italian passport.,Citizenship and Naturalization; Passports; Genealogy; Immigration and Emigration; Politics and Government,"Meloni, Giorgia (1977- ); Tajani, Antonio",Italy,,"Until last week, anyone who had an Italian ancestor who was alive after the country was formed in 1861 could seek citizenship. Reporting from RomeWhy Italy Made It Harder to Become ItalianThe government says it tightened citizenship rules because of a deluge of applications from the descendants of emigrants who only coveted an Italian passport. People of Italian descent have for decades been able to dig through their family trees, find an Italian ancestor and apply for citizenship to Italy, securing a powerful passport that allows them to enter more countries without a visa than travelers of almost any other nationality. But so many have tried to claim the benefit that their applications have congested Italy’s courts, consulates and municipal offices, grinding other work to a near halt. The government has had enough. Fewer people of Italian descent will now be able to obtain citizenship after the government narrowed eligibility only to those with Italian parents or grandparents. The decree, announced on Friday and effective immediately, strips away a provision that had allowed all comers to seek citizenship if they could prove — often through a lengthy and laborious process — that they had an Italian ancestor who was alive after the country was formed in 1861. Antonio Tajani, the Italian foreign minister, said the stricter regulations followed “years of abuses” by people who had few ties to the country and only coveted its passport. Italy has granted citizenship in recent years to a surging number of South Americans, Mr. Tajani said, suggesting that many new Italians mainly hoped to travel around Europe or to the United States. “Being an Italian citizen is a serious thing,” he said at a news conference. “It’s not a game to get a passport in your pocket to go shopping in Miami.”The move comes as many countries arerethinking who can be a citizenin response to a sharp rise in migration. In Italy, as in much of Europe, immigration law has been largely based on bloodlines, allowing the country to maintain ties with the descendants of millions of Italians who fled poverty and war in the 19th and 20th centuries. Yet Italy is facing ademographic crisisas the population ages and the birthrate plummets. Critics say it is unfair for Italy to grant citizenship to people with long-lost ancestry while denying birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants, including those with legal status. Italy allows children of lawful immigrants to become citizens only once they have turned 18 and if they have lived in the country since birth. Mr. Tajani said the government would pursue legislation that would allow the children or grandchildren of Italian citizens to obtain citizenship if they reside in Italy for two or three years, instead of the five or 10 years required for European citizens and other foreigners. That the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a nationalist, chose to impose restrictions on bloodline citizenship surprised and upset some on the political right, who argue that the government should preserve Italian cultural and ethnic identity. But Mr. Tajani said a lucrative cottage industry had profited from charging would-be Italians thousands of dollars to find ancestral records and submit citizenship applications. “We cannot encourage cheating or fake citizenship,” he said, holding up printouts of the companies’ ads on social media. One advertised a Black Friday special. An Italian passport offers visa-free travel to more countries than most. A surge in applications is overwhelming some of Italy’s institutions, with courts struggling to process requests and small towns inundated with requests for old birth, death and marriage records. Consular appointments are so scarce that Italian citizens abroad routinely log on to an online portal at midnight Italy time to try to secure one. The number of Italian citizens abroad grew about 40 percent over the last decade, to 6.4 million in 2024 from 4.6 million in 2014, in large part because of newly minted citizens, Mr. Tajani said. Italy granted citizenship to some 30,000 people in Argentina last year, up from 20,000 in 2023, and to around 20,000 people in Brazil, up from 14,000. (One Argentine who received Italian citizenship when hevisited Romein December: President Javier Milei.)Alberto Teso, the mayor of San Donà di Piave, a city near Venice,told the public broadcaster RAIin February that half of his staff worked full-time on citizenship applications for people — most of them from Brazil — who “will never set foot in our city.”Even before the decree was announced on Friday, Italy had already started rejecting more citizenship applications. In October, the Interior Ministry issued a memo based on recent rulings from the Italian Supreme Court that more narrowly interpreted citizenship law. It said that if applicants Italian ancestors had voluntarily acquired a new nationality while their children were minors, those children automatically lost their Italian citizenship. That meant the citizenship chain was broken. The memo left scores of applicants with limited recourse, even if they had been engaged in the citizenship process for years. Reddit threads and Facebook groups sharing advice on how to obtain citizenship filled with posts lamenting the time, effort and money lost.

Netanyahu Drops Nominee for Spy Chief After Backlash,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-trump-shin-bet.html,2025-04-01T13:14:35Z,World,Eli Sharvit was a controversial choice after Israel’s prime minister fired his predecessor. Revelations that he wrote a column criticizing President Trump may have helped sink his chances.,,"Netanyahu, Benjamin; Trump, Donald J; Bar, Ronen (1965- )",Israel,Shin Bet,"Eli Sharvit, a former commander of Israel’s navy, is being passed over for the country’s top intelligence job. Netanyahu Drops Nominee for Spy Chief After BacklashEli Sharvit was a controversial choice after Israel’s prime minister fired his predecessor. Revelations that he wrote a column criticizing President Trump may have helped sink his chances. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel backed away from his nominee to lead Israel’s domestic intelligence service on Tuesday, after conservative allies attacked the candidate for criticizing President Trump and Israeli media reported that he had protested judicial overhauls pushed by the government. Mr. Netanyahu hadbackedEli Sharvit, a former commander of Israel’s navy, to lead the Shin Bet intelligence agency after he dismissed his predecessor, Ronen Bar. But the Israeli leader dropped Mr. Sharvit a day after the Monday announcement amid a backlash from the right, partly because he had written a column two months ago criticizing Mr. Trump for rolling back policies to fight climate change. Mr. Netanyahu’s office said that he had met with Mr. Sharvit to inform him that he would pursue other candidates for the job, without specifying a reason. As the country’s domestic security agency, the Shin Bet plays a key role in the war in Gaza and Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank. Mr. Netanyahuremoved Mr. Bar from the postlast month, saying he could no longer trust him. Critics called the move an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to purge dissenting views from the top ranks of Israel’s security establishment and the decision prompted protests. Under Mr. Bar’s direction, the Shin Bet has been involved in investigating some of Mr. Netanyahu’s aides’ ties with Qatar, including over accusations that they received payments from people connected to the Qatari government. Israel’s Supreme Court is scheduled to hear petitions against Mr. Bar’s removal by next week, and Israeli legal experts say it may reverse Mr. Netanyahu’s decision. Mr. Netanyahu’s left-wing and centrist opponents had feared that he would try to tighten his grip over the agency by appointing a close adviser. But many hailed Mr. Sharvit, who retired from the military in 2021, as an experienced and capable soldier. There was a fierce and immediate right-wing response, however. In 2023, Mr. Sharvit participated in demonstrations against Mr. Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul, according to Yediot Aharonot, a major Israeli newspaper. The proposals, which aimed to weaken Israel’s judiciary, prompted mass protests as many Israelis decried them as a threat to the country’s democracy. Mr. Sharvit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tally Gotliv, a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party, denounced Mr. Sharvit as someone who had “undermined” the prime minister. “I would not have nominated him to this important post,” she said in a video posted on social media. “Sir, think it over again.”It then emerged that Mr. Sharvit had written an opinion column in January criticizingMr. Trump’s policies rolling backefforts aimed at limiting pollution and strengthening the fossil fuel industry. After leaving the military, Mr. Sharvit worked as anexecutivein the green energy sector, and the article dealt with Mr. Trump’s climate change policy rather than any of the sensitive security issues that fall under the purview of the Shin Bet. “Trump’s shortsightedness sends a terrible message to the world of disregard for scientific reality, the well-being of humanity, and responsibility to future generations,” Mr. Sharvit wrote in Calcalist, an Israeli economic daily. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a key ally of Mr. Trump, called for Mr. Netanyahu to withdraw Mr. Sharvit’s nomination, saying that his appointment was “beyond problematic.”“The statements made by Eli Sharvit about President Trump and his polices will create unnecessary stress at a critical time,” Mr. Graham wrote on social media on Monday. “My advice to my Israeli friends is change course and do better vetting.”In another policy change seemingly aimed at Mr. Trump, the Israeli government announced on Tuesday that it was moving to cancel Israel’s remaining tariffs on American imports. Mr. Trump has vowed to announce an array of new tariffs this week that would affect goods across the world. Israel and the United States have a decades-old free trade agreement that excludes most American products from tariffs. Import taxes — mostly from imported food — amounted to $11.3 million annually, according to the Israeli finance ministry. Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints: President Trump is more aligned than his predecessoron Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition. Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks: Many Israelis were surprisedwhen Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effortto rein in the country’s nuclearprogram. Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief: Israel’s highest court began hearing a case over Netanyahu’s decision to replace one of his top intelligence chiefs — a courtroom battle thatcould open the door to a constitutional crisis.

SpaceX Puts Humans in Orbit Over Earth’s Poles for the First TimeChun Wang, a Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur, paid an undisclosed amount for the mission. Some satellites are already in polar orbit, and researchers called it a routine flight. A SpaceX rocket blasted off Monday night from Florida, the first trip to put humans into an orbit that takes them over both of Earth’s poles. A spacecraft orbiting over the poles can observe the entire planet as it spins underneath. The path is particularly useful for weather, mapping and spy satellites. With many of these satellites already in polar or near-polar orbit, researchers said that a mission sending humans around the poles was not especially remarkable from a scientific perspective. Still, the mission, which SpaceX says will last three to five days, captured some attention. It was financed by Chun Wang, an investor who made his fortune in blockchain and cryptocurrency mining. Mr. Wang paid an undisclosed amount and selected three people to accompany him. During the mission, called Fram2, the four private astronauts are orbiting about 270 miles above Earth in their SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, passing over the North and South Poles multiple times a day. Mr. Wang, 42, was born in Tianjin, China, andbecame a citizen of Maltain 2023. His spacesuit bears the flag of Malta. Fram2 said in a release that the launch could “unlock new possibilities for human spaceflight and provide a deeper understanding about our planet and its polar regions.”Though it could offer some insights, “it’s run of the mill as far as I can tell,” said Dr. Bleddyn Bowen, an associate professor in astropolitics at Durham University in England. Human spaceflights were always seeking new findings, he said, and for launch operators in Florida the mission was more practice in managing a polar launch. What was more interesting, Dr. Bowen said, was the crew of the mission. “Human spaceflight is a money pit,” he said, adding that flights were often funded by wealthy people who believed in space travel. But there are still questions about whether commercial interest in space travel could sustain, for example, a commercial space station, he said. “Is this flight really just the start of a very specific kind of sustained demand from the ultra wealthy of the world?” he asked. “Or is it something that’s going to happen a few times and then interest will die out?”Theother crew membersare Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian filmmaker; Rabea Rogge, a robotics researcher from Germany; and Eric Philips, an Australian explorer who specializes in expeditions to the polar regions. Mr. Wang named the mission after the Fram,a Norwegian shipthat explored the Arctic in the 19th century. At the end of the flight, the Dragon spacecraft is expected to splash down off the coast of Southern California,SpaceX said. The company has taken private astronauts into space before, including ona mission last yearled by the billionaire Jared Isaacman. Blue Origin, a rival company owned by Jeff Bezos, has been flying private astronauts on brief suborbital journeys into space since 2021. Its next flightis expected to launch on April 14 with an all-female crew, including the TV journalist Gayle King and the singer Katy Perry.

After years of NASA and private crews returning to Earth near Florida,SpaceX shifted its landing zone to the West Coastfor the private Fram2 mission.

Reporting from Vatican CityPope Francis’ Health Continues to Improve, Vatican SaysA little over a week after returning to the Vatican guesthouse to convalesce, the pope was showing gradual improvements in his movements and speech. Pope Francis’ health has continued to improve in the week since he left the hospital after a weekslong stay, the Vatican said Tuesday. During Francis’ 38-day stay at Policlinico A. Gemelli in Rome, he was treated for pneumonia and other infections. He experienced two episodes — abreathing crisisand a bronchial spasm that caused himto inhale some vomit— so severe that doctors said they did not think thathe was going to make it, but survived and was discharged on March 23 to convalesce at his Vatican guesthouse. On Tuesday, the Vatican said that the pope’s blood tests were normal and that a recent X-ray showed a “slight improvement” in his lungs. Francis still uses oxygen throughout the day but can go without that for brief periods, the Vatican said. Motor and respiratory therapy were also showing results, the Vatican added, saying that Francis’ voice was improving and that he was moving with greater ease. Francis has not appeared in public since the day he left the hospital andbriefly greetedwell-wishers from a balcony. That appearance offered a sobering glimpse of the toll that the health crisis had taken on the 88-year-old pontiff. His voice was weak, his breathing strained and he struggled to raise his hands to give a blessing. When the doctors discharged Francis, they implored him to rest and convalesce for at least two months. So far, it appears he has largely heeded their pleas. The Vatican said on Tuesday that Francis had not had any visitors since returning to the guesthouse but celebrates Mass with other priests every morning and spends part of the day seated at his desk working. In the past week, Francis has approved the canonization of Venezuela’s first female saint and the first saint for Papua New Guinea, where he traveled last September on agrueling trip to the Asia-Pacific region. He also has appointed several bishops and offered prayers for the victims of the powerfulearthquake in Southeast Asia. And he has mused on his condition. In his traditional Angelus prayer and blessing on Sunday — a written message in place of his typical delivery overlooking St. Peter’s Square — Francis urged the faithful to experience the Lenten period leading to Easter “as a period of healing.”“I too am experiencing it this way, in my soul and in my body,” Francis said in written text published on the Vatican website.

Iceland Volcano Eruption Threatens TownThe eruption began near Grindavik, a small town long threatened by volcanic disruptions, and prompted the closure of a popular tourist destination. A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted on Tuesday, endangering the town of Grindavik and promptingthe closure of the popular Blue Lagoontourist destination. It was the 11th eruption to shake the country’s Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021 as Iceland faces a period ofintense geological activity. Aerial video released by the authorities showed lava snaking along the ground as white clouds billowed into the air after the eruption, whichstarted at 9:45 a.m. Grindavik, a small fishing village about 25 miles southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, has been threatened by eight of the 11 eruptions in recent years. It has also beenrepeatedly evacuated, including on Tuesday, the town’s fire chief, Einar Jonsson, said in an interview. Emergency alarms blared in the town, and officials went door to door to about 40 houses that were registered as occupied, according to Mr. Jonsson. He said that although several residents initially resisted, officials had declared the town empty of civilians by noon. A fissure had grown to about three-quarters of a mile long by about 12:30 p.m., Iceland’s meteorological office said. It appeared to be growing southward, the office said, and Grindavik was in its path. Much remains uncertain. Magnus Gudmundsson, a geophysicist, said he had seen fountains of lava spewing high into the area as he flew over the fissure on Tuesday morning, although he said that by midday it seemed that lava would not reach Grindavik. “Time can only tell,” he said. Iceland has tried to use infrastructure to protect the town: Since 2023, the government hasbuilt a series of protective barriers, made from boulders the size of small cars, to try to redirect lava away from Grindavik and a nearby geothermal power station. But barriers can do only so much. A photo shared by the meteorological office showed the fissure reaching through the barriers like a train breaking through a wall. By midmorning, it said, another fissure had opened between the barriers and the town. For some residents, the disruptions were all too familiar. Thormar Omarsson, who owns a pizzeria in the area, said he was about to drive to work on Tuesday when he heard that an eruption was predicted. His business is in the center of Grindavik, so he was unable to open it on Tuesday. He used to live in Grindavik but sold his house in August after repeated evacuations. He now lives in nearby Keflavik, close to the country’s main international airport, whichsaid that flights had not been affected by the eruption“We have fridges full of food,” Mr. Omarsson said, fretting about his pizzeria. “I hope we can reopen soon.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Reporting from BangkokA Symbol of a City’s Rapid Growth Comes Crashing DownThe collapse of the Sky Villa complex in the Myanmar city of Mandalay buried an unknown number of people amid the earthquake on Friday that killed more than 2,700. It was marketed as a place with an “earthquake-resistant foundation.” The 12-story Sky Villa Condominium complex featured the largest rooftop bar in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay and a gym with state-of-the-art equipment. Now it is a tomb. Sky Villa, which was built in 2017, was one of the hardest-hit sites in the devastating earthquake on Friday that killed 2,719 people. Until last week, it stood as a symbol of this city’s rapid urbanization despite a four-year civil war. When the earthquake ravaged Myanmar, five stories of the condominium slid underground. On Tuesday, the air reeked of decaying corpses, the stench made worse by the 100-degree heat, as desperate family members circled the ruins of the building looking for loved ones. “Please speed up!” shouted Sai Myo Tun, who was searching for his sister, to volunteers in yellow hard hats and Chinese rescue workers scrambling to untangle the mound of concrete, debris, and steel. “My sister can still be alive if you speed up.”Members of a Chinese search-and-rescue team transferring a pregnant survivor from a collapsed building in Mandalay, on Monday. Mr. Sai Myo Tun said his sister, who is three months pregnant, and her husband were trapped under the building. He said his sister had bought an apartment in Sky Villa last year. It is not known how many other people may be under the ruins. “The rescue teams say there may not be any survivors left,” he said. “But I’m still holding on to hope.”In recent years, Mandalay has been the site of a building boom, its fancy nightclubs and rising apartment blocks a sign of increased social mobility. A center of Buddhist culture and the last royal capital before the kingdom was annexed by the British Empire in 1885, it is a sprawling city of about 1.5 million and home to multiple religions and ethnicities. That includes many Chinese who arrived in the 20th century. Since the army seized power in a coup four years ago, it has also emerged as an epicenter of resistance. Today, it is a city destroyed. On Tuesday, a gold mine collapsed in Mandalay’s Singu township, killing 27, according to Myanmar Rescue Let Pan Hla, a local group. For days, volunteers have been combing through the rubble of collapsed buildings with their bare hands. Heavy machinery finally arrived on Saturday with a rescue team from China. Images from Myanmar and ThailandThe Tragedy in Photos and Video“The smell of decomposing bodies is getting stronger, so I don’t think there will be any survivors,” said Kyaw Gyi, a volunteer helping with rescue efforts at Sky Villa. He said on Tuesday morning that a cat made it out alive, but no human survivors had been found. “I estimate that at least 100 people are still inside.”Bananas had been placed on a table near the ruins of the condominium, as prayer offerings. Daw Thet Tin, who said her daughter and granddaughter are trapped under the building, has kept vigil at a nearby monastery. “Lin Lin, dear, Mama is right here!” she shouted in the direction of the building. “The rescue teams are working to save you, stay strong!”Ms. Thet Tin said she had not left the monastery since the day of the earthquake. “Every day, I pray to Buddha for them,” she said. The destruction in Mandalay has been widespread. An analysis of Mandalayby Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab showed 515 buildings were 80 percent to 100 percent damaged, and another 1,524 were 20 percent to 80 percent damaged. It was not clear what percentage of the city’s buildings those numbers represented. Residents taking shelter in a makeshift tent camp in Mandalay on Monday. Rural parts of Mandalay have been ignored for days as rescue teams focus on the downtown areas. Some of these are impoverished areas where Muslims, a minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, are concentrated, aid groups say. “They’re not receiving any support or aid, even though there’s been a lot of deaths there as well,” said Melody Crisp of Thr5ve, a nonprofit helping displaced communities. Ms. Crisp said that in parts of Mandalay, the authorities were telling people to return home by 10 p.m. and threatening forced military service if they didn’t comply, citing her contacts in the city. Families are sleeping on sidewalks in the city, swarmed by mosquitoes at night. There are fears that clean water and food could soon run out. Haider Yaqub, the Myanmar country director for Plan International, a child rights organization, has been interviewing residents to assess what their needs are. He said they desperately need shelter and fuel  to help with rescue efforts. Many of the collapsed structures were some of the country’s historic and religious sites such as mosques, pagodas and monasteries.

A Prison Death Highlights an L.G.B.T.Q. Crackdown in RussiaThe Russian government has unleashed a wave of repression against L.G.B.T.Q. people, with the police raiding gay night clubs and investigators targeting people they suspect of being gay. The travel agency offered tours aimed solely at men, and that was enough to attract the attention of the police enforcing new Russian laws that restrict the rights of gay people. One night in December, officers stormed the apartment of the agency’s owner and tied him up, he later told a court. “Fifteen people came to my place at night,” said the owner, Andrei Kotov. “They were beating me in the face, kicking me and leaving bruises.” His comments were reported by Russian media and confirmed by his lawyer. Mr. Kotov said the officers pressured him to “confess” that he was running a travel agency aimed at gay people, which he denied. The officers kept beating him, he said, and told him: “No trips for gays.”A few weeks later, Mr. Kotov, then 48, was found dead in his prison cell. Prison officials told his mother that he cut himself with a razor, said his lawyer, Leysan Mannapova. The circumstances of his death could not be independently determined, and Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Kotov’s death reflects an increasingly harsh crackdown in Russia on the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. people that has accelerated since the start of the war in Ukraine. President Vladimir V. Putin has portrayed the new restrictions — and the war — as part of a broader battle to maintain “Russian traditional values.”In November 2023, the Russian Supreme Courtdesignatedthe “international L.G.B.T.Q. movement” as an “extremist organization” on par with the likes of Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. Under laws targeting extremist groups, gay rights activists, their lawyers or others involved in efforts to support L.G.B.T.Q. people could facejail sentences of six to 10 years. That has led to a wave of repression against L.G.B.T.Q. people and groups, with the police raiding gay night clubs and investigators targeting ordinary Russians, according to members of the community andgroupslike Human Rights Watch. At least 12 criminal inquiries on the L.G.B.T.Q. extremism charges were initiated last year, according to the Russian prisoner rights advocacy group OVD-Info. Denis Olyenik, executive director of Coming Out, which helps L.G.B.T.Q. people in Russia, said the authorities’ pressure had initially focused on rights groups and activists. “Now, the crackdown is reaching out to ordinary people, clubs, parties — it affected the community that previously would even distance itself from rights advocacy,” he said. Homosexuality was decriminalized Russia in 1993, inspiring a vibrant gay scene that included celebrities openly talking about their sexuality and the establishment of gay clubs. Tatu, a pop group whose two female members pretended to be a lesbian couple, kissing between songs, was even picked by state-owned television to represent Russia at international contests. But in 2013, Mr. Putin opened a salvo against gay people when he signed a bill outlawing the dissemination of what it described as “gay propaganda” — which includes material that makes “nontraditional relations attractive” — to minors. In 2022, Russia introduced fines for promoting “gay propaganda.”Then came the 2023 court ruling that led to the current crackdown. After Mr. Kotov, the travel agent, was arrested, he was also charged with producing images of child sexual abuse, but his lawyer was not able to review case materials on that charge. During his arraignment hearing in December, an investigator told the court, without giving further details, that images on Mr. Kotov’s phone proved that he committed a crime “aimed against the constitutional order and security of the state.”A few weeks later, Mr. Kotov was dead. Just two days earlier, a psychological evaluation for Mr. Kotov did not show any suicidal tendencies, said Ms. Mannapova, his lawyer. Mr. Kotov’s mother has asked the prosecutors to go ahead with his case posthumously so that he could be cleared of the allegations against him, his lawyer said. “It was utterly unclear to him how arranging trips for men can be considered setting up an extremist group,” she said. Law enforcement officers blocking participants at a Pride rally in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2019. The night after the Supreme Court outlawed the L.G.B.T.Q. movement in 2023, Sergei Artyomov, a 36-year-old gay man from Moscow, said he and his friends were targeted in a police raid at a Moscow nightclub. The officers blocked off the exits, made patrons stand against a wall and then wrote down their ID details, he said. No one was arrested, but Mr. Artyomov, who used to work as a TV producer, said the experience rattled him. He said that he had already been thinking about leaving Russia as he wanted to live as an openly gay man, and that the raid strengthened his resolve. “I knew things would only get worse,” he said. “There is no gray area anymore. They call you an enemy of the people, and that’s it.”He left just before Christmas for Spain, where he said he was granted asylum. The Kremlin-driven anti-gay campaign has been whipped up by vigilante groups as well as local officials and state media. In the remote eastern Siberian city of Yakutia, Pryany Yakutsk, a popular media channel on Telegram, raised alarm over the holidays about “debauchery and corruption of men happening under the very nose of law enforcement and the officials in Yakutsk.”It published two grainy photos from a nightclub party depicting what appeared to be bare-breasted women, one of them on a naked man. The message on the Telegram channel said the party featured what it called “transvestite performers” from Thailand. A court later fined the club 250,000 rubles, or about $2,800, for violating public order since its patrons were “in a state of undress that insults human dignity and promotes nontraditional sexual relations.”Russian Community, a nationalist group that styles itself as social vigilantes, has also posted photos and videos from police raids. Last year, the grouppostedvideo ofa raidon an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in the city of Orenburg that showed several young people lying on the floor, face down, being arrested. Acriminal casewas later brought against the club’s owner, manager and art director, who are still awaiting trial. State media has also been bombarding Russians with messaging about the virtues of heterosexual families with children. Earlier this year, Mr. Putin issued anorderfor his government to come up with a strategy to promote families with multiple children. Since the Kremlin introduced the first anti-gay bill in 2013, the number of Russians who think gay people should not have the same rights as others hasincreasedfrom 47 to 62 percent, according to the independent pollster Levada. Young Russians are still far more accepting of L.G.B.T.Q. people than older ones,opinionpolls show, but have also heard constant denunciations of them in the media over the past year. “That torrent of gay and trans hatred that keeps pouring out from all media is going to have consequences,” said Tatyana Vinnichenko, a veteran L.G.B.T.Q. activist living in exile in Lithuania. The trans community has been a particular target of the authorities, with the adoption of alawin 2023 banning trans health care and changing gender identifiers in official documents. The latest round of repressions has spurred a silent exodus of gay and trans people from Russia, activists say. But Tahir, a 25-year-old gay man who asked that his family name be withheld for fear of criminal prosecution, said he had no intention of leaving. “I definitely know that things will get worse,” he said. “But I don’t want to leave.

These Militias Refuse to Join Syria’s New Army,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/middleeast/syria-israel-border.html,2025-04-01T09:00:38Z,World,The militias that control the Druse religious minority’s heartland in southwestern Syria have resisted the new government’s attempts to bring all armed groups under its control.,War and Armed Conflicts; Druse (Sect); Kurds,"al-Shara, Ahmed (Abu Mohammad al-Jolani) (1982- ); Assad, Bashar al-",Damascus (Syria); Syria; Israel,," Reporting from Sweida, SyriaThese Militias Refuse to Join Syria’s New ArmyThe militias that control the Druse religious minority’s heartland in southwestern Syria have resisted the new government’s attempts to bring all armed groups under its control. The trainer paced the grounds of a mountain enclave in southwestern Syria, shouting at dozens of new recruits as they drilled sprints between barricades made from old car tires. “You have to practice as if it’s real,” screamed the instructor, Fadi Azam. “Want me to start shooting at you instead to make it real?” he said, lifting his rifle and firing a few rounds away from the group, the paw-paw-paw of gunfire echoing across the valley on a brisk morning in late January. “You are lions, lions!” Mr. Azam yelled at the recruits, some of the tens of thousands of fighters from Syria’s Druse religious minority whose powerful militias control the rugged province of Sweida, southwest of the capital, Damascus. Sweida is the heartland of the Druse — a strategically important region bordering Jordan and near Israel — and these fighters stand to play a small but essential role in Syria’s future. As the Islamist rebels who ousted the dictator Bashar al-Assad in December set up a new government, they are seeking to fold disparate militias including this one, which sprung up during Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war, into a single national force. A unified military is crucial to securing control over the entire country and establishing stability, but that goal has proved elusive. Since January, several of the strongest Druse militias had been in talks with the government about their conditions for joining the new army. They were skeptical over the interim president’s pledges to protect the rights of Syria’s many religious and ethnic minorities. Those talks stalled last month after an outburst of violence against another religious minority, heightening the concerns of the Druse. The violence began with an attack by remnants of the old regime on the new government’s security forces in a region dominated by the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Mr. al-Assad’s family are Alawites, and during the family’s five decades ruling Syria, they often prioritized members of the sect in security and military jobs. The government responded by mobilizing its security forces, which other armed groups and armed civilians joined, according to witnesses and rights groups. These fighters — some nominally under the government’s control and others outside it — killed hundreds of Alawite civilians in what the rights groups said were sectarian-driven attacks. Druse militia leaders have also accused the interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, of monopolizing power. Mr. al-Shara and many in his cohort were part of an Islamist rebel group, dominated by members of Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority, that was once linked to Al Qaeda. They showed little willingness initially to cede power in their new government to minorities. However, when Mr. al-Sharaannounced a caretaker governmentlate Saturday, his choices acknowledged to some extent the pressure to form an inclusive administration representing Syria’s many diverse ethnic and religious groups. He appointed a Kurdish minister of education, a Christian woman minister and a Druse minister, among others. Still, the crucial ministries of defense, foreign affairs and interior will be run by the president’s close allies. Armed Druse men singing and dancing outside the offices of the Mountain Brigade, a Druse militia, in the southwestern province of Sweida. Another powerful militia, a Kurdish-led force that governs much of northeastern Syria and is backed by the United States, has agreed to a preliminary deal to join the national army but has not yet integrated, expressing concerns similar to those of the Druse. Unless he can persuade the Druse militias and other armed groups to integrate into a national army, Mr. al-Shara will face a difficult choice. He must either agree to cede some authority and establish a somewhat decentralized government or risk ruling only part of the country — much as Mr. al-Assad did during the civil war. Mr. al-Shara “is in a political deadlock with the Druse and the Kurds and doesn’t have much leverage,” said Mohammad al-Abdallah, a Syrian political analyst. In the meantime, the Druse militias have bolstered their ranks, exerting authority across the region to fill the security void left by the collapse of the Assad regime. The recruits training recently in Sweida were part of the Mountain Brigade, one of several Druse militias that emerged during the civil war. The brigade’s ranks have swelled from 2,000 fighters to more than 7,000, their leaders say, amid the uncertainty of this transition of power. “We want to defend our people, defend our homeland,” said Rakan Kahool, 28, who signed up with the militia in January. “The people of Sweida should protect Sweida.”A market in the provincial capital of Sweida. The province, southwest of Damascus, is the Druse heartland and a strategically important area. New recruits like Mr. Kahool and veteran fighters have been acting as the de facto police and security forces for Sweida Province, staffing checkpoints and patrolling the border with Jordan. The Mountain Brigade’s commander, Sheqib Azam, said in an interview that the Druse militia leaders wanted to give the interim government a chance to prove themselves. “If the new government works in the right way, we will join them,” Mr. Azam said. “And if not, we will fight them.”He has taken part in the discussions with Syria’s new authorities over joining the national army that reached an impasse in recent weeks. “We want to be a part of the state, to have a say in political decisions,” he said. But he added, “It’s too early to give up our weapons.”Should the Druse militias strike a deal with the new government, their fighters will be key to maintaining security in the southwest in the face of threats from the Islamic State, armed remnants of Assad regime and criminal groups, as well as Israeli incursions along the southern border. Any disruptions could plunge Syria into another cycle of violence and factionalism. Israel’s actions in response to the collapse of the Assad regime is injecting even more uncertainty into the political landscape of southwestern Syria. Israel wants to ensure that no hostile forces entrench themselves in the parts of Syria near its borders, where they could easily launch attacks against northern Israel as Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group, did for years from neighboring Lebanon. Military training for Druse men by the Mountain Brigade near Sweida. And the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that Israel will not tolerate the presence of Mr. al-Shara’s Turkish-backed Sunni Muslim forces south of Damascus. Israeli officials have referred to those forces as extremists. Since the Assad regime fell, Israel has struck several hundred targets in Syria, knocking out weapons depots and other military assets from the former regime to keep them from falling into the hands of anyone hostile to Israel, according to Israeli officials. Israeli officials have also warned the Syrian authorities that they would intervene militarily to protect the Druse from any government crackdown, an overture that reflects the strong relationship that the Israeli state has with its own Druse minority. The Druse, who practice a religion that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam, can also be found in Lebanon and Jordan. The major Syrian Druse militias have rejected the offer. Although they have not yet agreed to join the national military, Druse militias and religious leaders have established informal arrangements with the new authorities that allow them to receive government aid while still maintaining their military control over Sweida. In January, Mr. Azam said, he agreed to have an official from Mr. al-Shara’s former rebel group serve as a temporary provincial governor of Sweida, on the condition that government forces not deploy to Sweida. In the weeks since the arrival of the interim governor, Mustafa Yasin Baquer, hundreds of people have crowded into his office each day to request support. The electricity works for only an hour a day, residents say. The water supply is erratic. Some want land stolen by the Assad government returned to them. Others, who once relied on subsidized bread under the old rulers, begged for similar aid. Workers repairing a room inside the Sweida Governorate building. “The infrastructure is completely destroyed,” Mr. Baquer said in an interview. While the negotiations with the Druse militias continue, the transitional government must “step in and try to stabilize the situation,” he added. Many residents in Sweida share that sentiment. One recent afternoon, Janat Abu al-Fadl, 55, meandered along the narrow cobblestone roads of Sweida’s market with her daughter. While both were uncertain about Syria’s new authorities, Ms. al-Fadl said she was hopeful about the future of Syria for the first time in decades. “It will take time, and there will be a difficult period at first of course, but eventually I think things will improve,” she said. “Before the regime fell, we had no hope,” she added. “Now, at least, we have something.”The Mountain Brigade’s new recruits in formation.

They are a major employer, but residents say those jobs have come with a steep cost. Even in a frequently fogbound port city along the Atlantic Ocean, the billowing clouds of steam rising from Canada’s largest oil refinery over Saint John, New Brunswick, are impossible to miss. On a ridge overlooking the refinery sit six enormous tanks, each containing one million barrels of crude oil. Letters painted in dark blue spell “Irving,” the family whose businesses dominate not only Saint John, but most of New Brunswick. The larger of the Irvings’ two local paper mills looms above the Saint John River like a medieval fortress. Irving-owned railway tracks crisscross the city, linking smaller factories owned by the family to ports under Irving control. Irving-owned building-supply stores and gas stations dot the streets in this city of 78,000 people, where park signs honor Irving contributions to their upkeep. Tanks spelling out the Irving name at the oil refinery. The family’s businesses dominate the city of Saint John in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

The family’s four radio stations in New Brunswick fill the airwaves. And Irving-owned transport trucks carry Irving-made goods, like structural steel and frozen French fries. An Irving-owned security company provides guards for Irving-owned properties. Canada has many families that have built business empires, most notably the Thomson family,which controls Thomson-Reuters,the media, financial and legal information company. But the Irvings stand out for their command of a single region. Starting in the 1920s with a general store and gas station that sold Ford Model Ts, Kenneth Colin Irving, who was known as K.C., established a privately owned family business now worth an estimated 14.5 billion Canadian dollars, or about $10.1 billion. The family’s legacy in Canada is complicated. Its companies have brought employment to a region where jobs are scarce. By some estimates, one out of every 10 people in New Brunswick works for an Irving company. Still, the province consistently ranks at or near the bottom in Canada for family income. And while Irving companies have created large industries, its factories have also brought pollution to Saint John and blighted its neighborhoods, according to residents and former government officials. But the family’s economic power and political influence have made many people in Saint John reluctant to openly criticize the Irvings. The family’s decision in 2003 to close its shipyard in Saint John, which once employed 4,000 people, to concentrate on its operation in Halifax, Nova Scotia was widely seen as a consequence of fractious labor relations.

Uptown Saint John before the construction of the new Irving Oil headquarters, which was completed in 2018. “There is a culture in Saint John of keeping your head down and keeping your mouth shut,” said Don Darling, the city’s mayor from 2016 to 2021. He said he believed that Saint John’s strong industrial base should make the local economy stronger, but that the relatively low taxes on many Irving-owned businesses have made it difficult to support needed social services. “I don’t blame the Irvings necessarily,’’ he added. “But everybody has to play a role and everyone should take responsibility for their part in the community.”Don Darling, the former mayor of Saint John, near the Irving Oil refinery.

In 2018, the residents of Pleasant City Street in Saint John East were twice jolted by the Irving refinery. First, a leaky pipe led to an explosion that injured 36 workers.

Irving Oil was fined 200,000 Canadian dollars, about $140,000, for the explosion, and Pleasant City Street was forever changed. Irving bought about 20 houses near the pipeline and demolished them, apparently to create a buffer between the refinery and residents. The abandoned neighborhood is now blocked off by concrete barriers and patrolled by Irving-employed guards. Like other people in Saint John, Lisa Crandall, who lives near the barriers, said she knew of family members and pets that had died from unusual cancers. But there has been little scrutiny of any health issues related to the Irving company by local government agencies or private groups. A 2009 study for the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, an advocacy group, found thatlung cancer ratesfor women in Saint John were 82 percent higher than national rates and 98 percent higher for men. There have been no known studies directly linking health problems to Irving-owned businesses. Lisa Crandall with her grandson Trey in the front yard of her home near the refinery.

The provincial government has declared thesereleases of dust and soot to be low riskto residents, but that has failed to reassure them. Fine particles have been linked to asthma, lung disease and bronchitis. Ms. Crandall said she was frustrated by the lack of communications from the company. To date, she said, it has offered no information about the bulldozing of houses on her street. “They don’t talk about it,” she said. “They just always send out a letter saying: Hi, we’re your neighbor. Sorry for the inconvenience.”K.C. Irving began the family’s empire by adding an oil company to his car dealership and gas station. During the Great Depression, he took over failing bus and truck companies, and after World War II expanded to paper, ships and lumber. The company’s growing influence brought concessions and tax breaks from government. In 1951, the province passed a law, which is no longer in force, allowing the Irving pulp mill to pour waste into the Saint John River. And Irving Oil was given a 42-year property tax exemption that ended in 2023. Patrons playing bingo at the Union Street Bingo Hall in uptown Saint John.

(Irving has not announced any such plans.)“It would be really good for the city,” she added. “I know a lot of people would hate me for saying that.”Mispec Beach, on the east side of Saint John, overlooks the Canaport liquefied natural gas plant, which is owned by Saint John.

U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong Officials for Pursuing Activists Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-hong-kong-sanctions.html,2025-04-01T07:26:09Z,World,China’s former top spy catcher is among six security enforcers targeted as the Trump administration turns its attention to human rights issues in the city.,United States International Relations; Embargoes and Sanctions; Politics and Government; Human Rights and Human Rights Violations,"Rubio, Marco",Hong Kong; United States,,"Dong Jingwei, the director of Beijing’s Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong, speaking during an event last year. Reporting from Hong KongU.S. Imposes Sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong Officials for Pursuing Activists AbroadChina’s former top spy catcher is among six security enforcers targeted as the Trump administration turns its attention to human rights issues in the city. The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China on Monday, targeting six high-level Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described as acts of transnational repression for their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil. The move was the first significant step by the new Trump administration to pressure China over human rights in Hong Kong. The State Department said in astatementthat the officials used the city’s national security laws “to intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists who had been forced to flee overseas, including a U.S. citizen and four other U.S. residents.”The sanctioned officials included Dong Jingwei, China’s top national security official in the city since 2023. In his previous role as China’s vice minister of state security, Mr. Dong led the country’s efforts to track dissidents and catch foreign spies. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Justice Paul Lam and Police Commissioner Raymond Siu were also among the six officials within national security bodies and the police force who were sanctioned for their roles in “coercing, arresting, detaining, or imprisoning” individuals under the national security law. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, left, Chief Executive John Lee, center, and Secretary for Security Chris Tang at a news conference regarding the new national security laws, last year in Hong Kong. In a national security crackdown since widespread unrest rocked the city in 2019, the Hong Kong authorities have jailed scores of opposition lawmakers, activists and others, including journalists, in the city. The state department also Monday released anannual reportsaying that the Hong Kong government had continued to use its broadnational security lawsto undermine human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong, a criticism other Western countries have also made. It noted that, as recently as December, the Hong Kong government had offered bounties for information leading to the arrests of dissidents living overseas. Hong Kong activists in the United States welcomed the move. “Many of us have endured relentless pressure and threats through transnational repression. It truly means a great deal to see the U.S. taking the lead in holding accountable the officials who orchestrated these actions,” Frances Hui, who was granted political asylum in the U.S., said in aon behalf of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation in Washington. Family members of overseas activists including Ms. Hui have been questioned in Hong Kong by its national security police. The Chinese embassy in Washington said in athat its enforcement of these laws, which were first imposed in 2020 in the aftermath of months of monthslong mass pro-democracy protests the year before, were “just and necessary” to return stability and prosperity to the Chinese territory. It also condemned the sanctions, calling it a “gross interference in China’s internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs.”The Hong Kong government described the sanctions as “despicable behavior” and acts of intimidation that “clearly exposed the U.S.’s barbarity.”The state department’s sanctions place restrictions on property ownership and financial dealings of the individuals in the United States. The U.S. has already sanctioned dozens of other Chinese and Hong Kong senior officials, issuing travel bans and directives to freeze assets imposed in2020and2021. Hong Kong Commissioner of Police Raymond Siu during a news conference in 2022. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, long an outspoken critic of China’s human rights record, said that Monday’s actions demonstrated the Trump administration’s commitment to hold to account those responsible for restricting freedoms of people in Hong Kong and pursuing those based overseas. Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a senior Fellow at The Jamestown Foundation in Washington, noted that while the sanctions were consistent with Mr. Rubio’s stance toward China, President Trump himself has not publicly placed much emphasis on supporting human rights in the region. The Trump administration has drastically cut funds to organizations that have long given a voice to dissident communities in China and other countries, includingVoice of America and Radio Free Asia“Trump himself doesn’t have that much of an interest in what’s happening in Tibet, in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong,” Mr. Lam said. “But it’s just another card to play in the longstanding systemic competition with China.”Pursuing Activists Abroad: The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China, targeting Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described asacts of transnational repressionfor their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil.

China’s Military Exercises Around Taiwan Enter Second Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-taiwan-military-drills.html,2025-04-01T05:58:51Z,World,"The drills came after Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, announced measures to counter China’s influence and espionage.

Reporting from Taipei, TaiwanChina’s Military Exercises Around Taiwan Enter Second DayThe drills came after Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, announced measures to counter China’s influence and espionage. Beijing also wants to send a message to Washington, analysts said. China held military exercises around Taiwan for a second day on Wednesday, sending warships and fighter planes near the island in what Beijing said was a warning to its president, Lai Ching-te, after he called China a “foreign hostile force.”The second day of exercises would focus on the Chinese military’s abilities to control and seal off seas and skies around Taiwan, Senior Col. Shi Yi, a spokesman for the People’s Liberation Army regional command that oversees Taiwan,said in a statement. Senior Colonel Shialso said thatin the East China Sea — farther from Taiwan — Chinese forces held live-fire long-distance strikes on “simulated targets of key ports and energy facilities.”Chinese officials have said that the display of military might was prompted by aspeech that Mr. Laigave on March 13, in which he called China a “foreign hostile force” and laid out 17 measures that he said would combat deepening Chinese subversion and spying in Taiwan. Those included restoring military tribunals to hear cases against military personnel accused of spying. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory, and officials describe Mr. Lai as an independence activist fundamentally opposed to their goals. President Lai Ching-te of Taiwan in Taipei last month, delivering a speech about Chinese subversion efforts. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said that 13 Chinese navy ships had been deployed on all sides of Taiwan, and another eight Chinese warships, including an aircraft carrier, were about 190 nautical miles west of the island. China had also deployed 10 coast guard ships, which often work closely with the military, around Taiwan and its smaller islands. Earlier in the day, the Taiwanese defense ministry said Chinese military aircraft had flown 76 sorties near Taiwan in the previous 24 hours. Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a Chinese military scholar who often serves as a spokesman, said that the exercises were intended to warn Taiwan of the risks and costs of a real blockade. “A joint blockade would use our big weaponry to stop Taiwan independence separatists from escaping, and prevent outside assistance from entering” the island,he said in a videoon China’s main military news website. “If Taiwan loses its sea supply lines, its domestic resources will be quickly exhausted, and its social order will descend into chaos.”But despite Beijing’s fiery language and sizable military display, experts said that the exercises appeared intended to intimidate Taiwan without tipping over into a wider confrontation. Mr. Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party deny that Taiwan is a part of China — a key premise of Beijing’s claim that the island is its territory — and officials in Beijing have already vehemently denounced Mr. Lai’s recent speech. On Tuesday, Chinese mediapublished cartoonsthat depicted Mr. Lai as a parasitic grub. “It’s trying to get in closer to Taiwan to exert more psychological pressure,” Su Tzu-yun, another researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said of China’s latest exercises. While Beijing has linked the exercises to Mr. Lai’s comments, Mr. Su and other experts said, China’s leaders also appeared to be sending an implicit message to the Trump administration. Mr. Lai has sought to maintain U.S. support for Taiwan during President Trump’s term, including by promising to raise its military spending to more than 3 percent of the island’s economic output this year. “The publicity around the exercise likely also has the U.S. in mind — they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the U.S. from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan,” saidAmanda Hsiao, an analyst for the Eurasia Group who monitors Chinese foreign policy and China-Taiwan tensions. The exercises came days after the U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, visited Tokyo to discuss strengthening military ties with Japan. Mr. Hegseth said there that the Trump administration would focus on countering Chinese power, including its efforts to squeeze Taiwan. “America is committed to sustaining robust, ready and credible deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait,” Mr. Hegsethsaid in a news conferencewith Japan’s defense minister, Gen Nakatani. Mr. Hegseth has also issued internal guidelines in the Pentagon that say U.S. forces must focus on deterring China from trying to seize Taiwan by force, TheWashington Post reported. The U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and Defense Minister Gen Nakatani of Japan in Tokyo on Sunday. Still, China may not have an appetite right now for extended military exercises that could deepen the divisions between the Trump administration and China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Xi is already squaring off with Mr. Trump over additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that wereimposed last month, with possibly moretariffs to come this week. The official Chinese statements about the latest exercises did not mention the United States. “China is definitely interested in not showing weakness,”Wen-Ti Sung, a researcher in Taiwan and a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said of Mr. Xi’s approach to the Trump administration. “But China will respond with just enough firmness to make sure that an off ramp for it still remains.”Pursuing Activists Abroad: The U.S. fired a new round of sanctions at China, targeting Chinese and Hong Kong officials over what it described asacts of transnational repressionfor their crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and on U.S. soil.

There’s No Party Like an Iftar Party for Bangladesh’s Aspiring Leaders,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/bangladesh-politics.html,2025-04-01T04:01:15Z,World,"During Ramadan, political parties used the events to signal potential alliances after the ouster of the country’s authoritarian leader.",Ramadan; Politics and Government,"Wazed, Hasina",Bangladesh,Bangladesh Nationalist Party; Jamaat-e-Islami,"Muslims preparing meals for iftar at the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in March. Reporting from Dhaka, BangladeshThere’s No Party Like an Iftar Party for Bangladesh’s Aspiring LeadersDuring Ramadan, political parties used the events to signal potential alliances after the ouster of the country’s authoritarian leader. Around sunset during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, something remarkable happens in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. The streets in this city of more than 10 million people, known for its hectic bustle and choking traffic, turn quiet and empty. But for political parties, which know well the persuasive powers of full bellies, sunset is their high time. Iftar parties, where the faithful break their fast, were closely watched through the end of Ramadan last week for what direction Bangladesh could take afterthe overthrow of its authoritarian leaderlast summer. Who was attending which party? Who was seated next to whom? In Bangladesh’s political vacuum, the answers to those questions offered clues to how new alliances could form and even the direction of changing geopolitical winds. To gauge the political temperature, we got ourselves invited to one. It was hosted at a rooftop restaurant by Gono Odhikar Parishad, a small party born of an earlier wave of student protests in 2018, before the one last year that toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protesters using heavy machinery to demolish the residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s former leader and the father of the country’s ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka in February. The party had made arrangements for 600 people, and 900 showed up. Plates of fried snacks and sweets were passed around. Waiters kept the yogurt drinks flowing. There was one thing no one seemed to have thought about: How do you get hundreds of people who have not eaten or hydrated for 15 hours to the top floor? Definitely not by climbing eight flights of stairs. The crowd, teeming in the tiny lobby painted like van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” tried to squeeze into one elevator with a capacity of 18 people. The elevator’s operator — which remains a thing in this part of the world — had a difficult job. A gentle man with a beard dyed red, he sat on a plastic stool by the buttons. He loaded every trip with the precision of a shopkeeper weighing grapes, offloading bodies one by one until the elevator was no longer over capacity. At the top, the restaurant heaved with people. Dozens of tables were marked RESERVED FOR POLITICAL PARTIES or RESERVED FOR JOURNALISTS. It was mostly men, with a sprinkling of women. Sangeeta Huq, a leader of the young party’s youth division, said she had attended five iftar parties in the first two weeks of Ramadan. Gono Odhikar Parishad party activists during a protest demanding a free and fair election under a caretaker government. “Each wing, each division of our own party has an iftar party — youth wing, labor wing, human rights wing,” she said. From the podium in front of her, speech after speech was directed less at the fasting guests and more at the couple dozen cameras. The theme was clear: The country needed an election. The timing of that election is at the heart of a political divide. Some want it right away. Others want reforms first, to avoid a repeat of past rigged votes. Dominating the news, and naturally the chatter at iftar parties, was the unease between Bangladesh’s military andthe student-driven interim government. The students are increasingly suspicious of the army chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman. Some think that the general, a relative of Ms. Hasina, the ousted prime minister, is trying to open space for a revival of her deposed party. Others suspect that the army chief is pressing for early elections because he has cut a deal with Ms. Hasina’s longtime opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or B.N.P. Leaders of that party, on the other hand, suspect that the students are using their sway over the government, and on the streets, to delay the election in order to buy time and organize as a political force themselves. The leader of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammad Yunus, right, sitting with Bangladesh’s army chief, Waker-Uz-Zaman, left, during an iftar event this month. Another big topic in Dhaka was where India — the giant neighbor that long supported Ms. Hasina and has now given her shelter — stood in all the political jostling. New Delhi seemed to broadly pin Ms. Hasina’s downfall on what it called a conspiracy between the B.N.P. and Jamaat-e-Islami, the main Islamist party, painting them both as extremist. But in a sign of changing times, Indian diplomats showed up at iftar gatherings for both parties. “Very busy time,” said Mia Golam Parwar, Jamaat’s general secretary, whose schedule during Ramadan revolved around iftar parties. “We feel like this is our high time.”He boasted that 39 diplomatic missions had been represented at Jamaat’s iftar party. Just around the corner from Gono Odhikar’s rooftop event, a local branch of the B.N.P. was hosting its own iftar party under a tent in a schoolyard. People sat at round tables as biryani boxes and soda cans were unloaded from a truck. A loudspeaker on the main road blared the names of the dozens of dignitaries in attendance. When the local B.N.P. leader, Ariful Islam Arif, took his turn at the mic on a crowded stage decked out in flowers, he got emotional. “I missed this for seven years because I was in jail,” he said.

"As Bangladesh Reinvents Itself, Islamist Hard-Liners See an Opening",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/bangladesh-islam.html,2025-04-01T04:01:09Z,World,A brewing shift toward religious conservatism has emerged from the political vacuum in this country of 175 million people.,Minorities; Religion-State Relations; Ahmadiyya (Muslim Sect); Muslims and Islam; Fringe Groups and Movements; Women and Girls,"Wazed, Hasina; Yunus, Muhammad",Bangladesh,Jamaat-e-Islami,"Waiting to break the Ramadan fast this month at the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Reporting from Taraganj and Dhaka in BangladeshAs Bangladesh Reinvents Itself, Islamist Hard-Liners See an OpeningA brewing shift toward religious conservatism has emerged from the political vacuum in this country of 175 million people. The extremists began by asserting control over women’s bodies. In the political vacuum that has emerged after the overthrow of Bangladesh’s authoritarian leader, religious fundamentalists in one town declared that young women could no longer play soccer. In another, they forced the police to free a man who had harassed a woman for not covering her hair in public, then draped him in garlands of flowers. More brazen calls followed. Demonstrators at a rally in Dhaka, the capital, warned that if the government did not give the death penalty to anyone who disrespected Islam, they would carry out executions with their own hands. Days later, an outlawed group held a large march demanding an Islamic caliphate. As Bangladesh tries torebuild its democracyand chart a new future for its 175 million people, a streak of Islamist extremism that had long lurked beneath the country’s secular facade is bubbling to the surface. In interviews, representatives of several Islamist parties and organizations — some of which had previously been banned — made clear that they were working to push Bangladesh in a more fundamentalist direction, a shift that has been little noticed outside the country. The Islamist leaders are insisting that Bangladesh erect an “Islamic government” that punishes those who disrespect Islam and enforces “modesty” — vague concepts that in other places have given way to vigilantism or theocratic rule. Officials across the political spectrum who are involved in drafting potential amendments to the Constitution acknowledged that the document was likely to drop secularism as a defining characteristic of Bangladesh, replacing it with pluralism and redrawing the country along more religious lines. A banned group calling for an Islamic caliphate in Dhaka this month. The fundamentalist turn has been especially distressing for female students who helped oust the country’s repressive prime minister, Sheikh Hasina. They had hoped to replace her one-party rule with a democratic openness that accommodates the country’s diversity. But now they find themselves competing against a religious populism that leaves women and religious minorities, including Hindus and adherents of small sects of Islam, particularly vulnerable. “We were at the forefront of the protests. We protected our brothers on the street,” said Sheikh Tasnim Afroz Emi, 29, a sociology graduate from Dhaka University. “Now after five, six months, the whole thing turned around.”Critics say the country’s interim government, led by the 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has not pushed back hard enough against extremist forces. They accuse Mr. Yunus of being soft, lost in the weeds of democratic reforms, conflict-averse and unable to articulate a clear vision as extremists take up more public space. Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, has been accused by some of being too soft on Islamist hard-liners. His lieutenants describe a delicate balancing act: They must protect the right to free speech and protest after years of authoritarianism, but doing so provides an opening for extremist demands. The police, who largely deserted after Ms. Hasina’s fall and remain demoralized, can no longer hold the line. The military, which has taken up some policing duties, is increasingly at odds with the interim government and the student movement, which wants to hold officers accountable for past atrocities. What is beginning to happen in Bangladesh mirrors a wave of fundamentalism that has consumed the region. Afghanistan has become an extreme ethno-religious state, depriving women of the most basic liberties. In Pakistan, Islamist extremists have exerted their will through violence for years. In India, an entrenched Hindu right wing has undermined the country’s traditions of secular democracy. Myanmar is gripped by Buddhist extremists overseeing a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Nahid Islam, a student leader who was a government minister in Bangladesh’s interim administration before stepping away recently to lead a new political party, acknowledged “the fear is there” that the country will slip toward extremism. Nahid Islam, a leader of the student protest movement, said he hoped that values like democracy and cultural diversity could hold. But he is hopeful that despite changes in the Constitution, values like democracy, cultural diversity and an aversion to religious extremism can hold. “I don’t think a state can be built in Bangladesh that goes against those fundamental values,” he said. Some point to a Bengali culture with a deep tradition of art and intellectual debate. Others find hope in the shape of the country’s economy. Women are so integrated in Bangladesh’s economy —37 percentare in the formal labor force, one of the highest rates in South Asia — that any efforts to force them back into the home could result in a backlash. Extremist forces are trying to push their way into the picture after 15 years in which Ms. Hasina both suppressed and appeased them. She ran a police state that cracked down on Islamist elements, including those closer to the mainstream that could pose a political challenge. At the same time, she tried to win over Islamist parties’ religiously conservative base by allowing thousands of unregulated Islamic religious seminaries and putting $1 billion toward building hundreds of mosques. With Ms. Hasina gone, smaller extremist outfits that want to upend the system entirely, and more mainstream Islamist parties that want to work within the democratic system, appear to be converging on a shared goal of a more conservative Bangladesh. The largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, sees a big opportunity. The party, which has significant business investments, is playing a long-term game, analysts and diplomats said. While it is unlikely to win an election expected at the end of the year, the party hopes to capitalize on the discrediting of mainstream secular parties. Forcing women back into the home could bring a backlash. Mia Golam Parwar, Jamaat’s general secretary, said the party wanted an Islamic welfare state. The closest model, in its mix of religion and politics, is Turkey, he said. “Islam provides moral guidelines for both men and women in terms of behavior and ethics,” Mr. Parwar said. “Within these guidelines, women can take part in any profession — sports, singing, theater, judiciary, military and bureaucracy.”In the current vacuum, however, men at the local level have been coming up with their own interpretations of Islamic governance. In the farming town of Taraganj, a group of organizers decided last month to hold a soccer match between two teams of young women. The goal was to provide entertainment and inspire local girls. But as preparations got underway, a town mosque leader, Ashraf Ali, proclaimed that women and girls should not be allowed to play soccer. Sports organizers usually announce details of a game by sending loudspeakers tied to rickshaws around town. Mr. Ali matched them by sending his own speakers, warning people not to attend. A still image from a video of a soccer game that was rescheduled after Islamists blocked the initial attempt to hold a match. On Feb. 6, as the players were changing into their jerseys in classrooms turned into dressing rooms, local officials were holding a meeting about the game. Mr. Ali declared that he “would rather become a martyr than allow the match,” said Sirajul Islam, one of the organizers. The local administration caved in, announcing the game’s cancellation and putting the area under curfew. Taslima Aktar, 22, who had traveled four hours by bus to play in the match, said she had seen “a lot of cars, army and police,” who told the players that the match was off. Ms. Aktar said that in her decade playing soccer, this was the first time she had faced such opposition. “I am a bit afraid now of what could happen,” she said. The organizers managed to carry out a women’s match a couple of weeks later, in the presence of dozens of security forces. But as a precaution, they asked the young women to wear stockings under their shorts. With the preacher’s unrelenting threats, the organizers said they were not sure they would take the risk again. During an interview, Mr. Ali, the mosque leader, beamed with pride: He had turned something mundane into something disputed. In a rural area like Taraganj, he said, women’s soccer contributes to “indecency.”Women’s sports was just his latest cause. For years, he has preached and petitioned against the Ahmadiyya, a long-persecuted minority Muslim community, trying to drive its 500 members out of his area. The place of worship of the Ahmadiyya, a persecuted Muslim sect, was attacked by a mob on the night that Bangladesh’s government collapsed. The Ahmadiyya’s place of worship was attacked by a mob on the night that Ms. Hasina’s government collapsed, part of a national wave of anarchy that targeted minority religious sites, particularly those of Hindus. The Ahmadiyya community continues to live in fear; attendance at their prayer hall has shrunk by nearly half. They are not allowed to rebuild the hall’s destroyed sign or to broadcast their call to prayer from loudspeakers. Mr. Ali shrugged off any responsibility for the violence. But the sermons of preachers like him, declaring the Ahmadiyya heretics who need to be expelled, continue to blare. “The public is respectful,” said A.K.M. Shafiqul Islam, the president of the local Ahmadiyya chapter. “But these religious leaders are against us.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Reporting from Suffolk, England, and LondonThe U.K. Government Wouldn’t Ban Phones in Schools. These Parents Stepped Up. In Britain, amid growing evidence of harm to young people from extreme content online, a “Smartphone Free Childhood” campaign is going viral. The idea of getting her eldest child a smartphone had long felt inevitable, said Daisy Greenwell. But by early last year, when her daughter was 8 years old, it filled her with dread. When she talked to other parents, “everyone universally said, ‘Yes, it’s a nightmare, but you’ve got no choice,’” recalled Ms. Greenwell, 41. She decided to test that. A friend, Clare Fernyhough, had shared her concerns about the addictive qualities of smartphones and the impact of social media on mental health, so they created a WhatsApp group to strategize. Then Ms. Greenwell, who lives in rural Suffolk, in the east of England,posted her thoughts on Instagram. “What if we could switch the social norm so that in our school, our town, our country, it was an odd choice to make to give your child a smartphone at 11,” she wrote. “What if we could hold off until they’re 14, or 16?” She added a link to the WhatsApp group. The post went viral. Within 24 hours the group was oversubscribed with parents clamoring to join. Today, more than 124,000 parents of children in more than 13,000 British schools havesigneda pact created by Smartphone Free Childhood, the charity set up by Ms. Greenwell, her husband, Joe Ryrie, and Ms. Fernyhough. It reads: “Acting in the best interests of my child and our community, I will wait until at least the end of Year 9 before getting them a smartphone.” (Year 9 is equivalent to the American eighth grade.)The movement aligns with abroader shift in attitudes in Britain, as evidence mounts of theharms posedto developing brains by smartphone addiction and algorithm-powered social media. In onesurveylast year the majority of respondents — 69 percent — felt social media negatively affected children under 15. Nearly half of parents said they struggled to limit the time children spent on phones. Meanwhile the police andintelligence serviceshave warned of a torrent of extreme and violent contentreaching childrenonline, a trend examined in the hit TV showAdolescence, in which a schoolboy is accused of murder after being exposed to online misogyny. It became Britain’smost watchedshow, and on Monday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer metwith its creatorsin Downing Street, telling them he had watched it with his son and daughter. But he also said: “This isn’t a challenge politicians can simply legislate for.”Colindale Primary School, in the London borough of Barnet, which last month announced plans to become the first British borough to ban smartphones in all its public schools, partly thanks to the work of Smartphone Free Childhood. Other governments in Europe have acted to curb children’s smartphone use. In February, Denmarkannounced plans to ban smartphones in schools, while France barred smartphones in elementary schools in 2018. Norway plans to enforce a minimum age on social media. So far Britain’s government has appeared wary of intervening. Josh MacAlister, a Labour lawmaker, attempted to introduce a legal requirement to make all schools in England smartphone free. But the bill waswatered downafter the government made clear it would not support a ban, arguing that principals should make the decision. Some parents feel the need to act is urgent, especially as technology companies, including Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and X, formerly Twitter, haveended fact-checking operations, which many experts say will allow misinformation andhate speech to flourish“We don’t have years for things to change,” said Vicky Allen, 46, a mother from Henfield in southern England. “It does feel like it needs to be us.”She and a friend, Julia Cassidy, 46, successfully campaigned for their children's elementary school to limit phone use after Ms. Cassidy watched aChannel 4 documentaryabout smartphones in schools, and then came across Smartphone Free Childhood. Ms. Cassidy was going to give her son a phone when he turned 11, but said, “I’ve just done a very big U-turn.” Now, she plans to give him a phone that can be used only for calls and texts. The power of parents collectively delaying smartphones is key, Ms. Greenwell said, because it insulates children from peer pressure. “This problem isn’t that complicated,” she said. “If you have other people around you who are also doing the same thing, it’s actually amazingly, beautifully simple.”‘Most people just want to keep their children safe’On a recent Friday morning, dozens of parents gathered in the auditorium of Colindale Primary School in north London for a presentation by Nova Eden, a regional leader for Smartphone Free Childhood. She described startling data — that the average 12-year-old in Britain spends 21 hours a week on a smartphone, for example, and that 76 percent of 12- to 15-year-olds spend most of their free time on screens. She also talked about emerging research on the impact of smartphone use. Ms. Eden cited studies showing rates of anxiety, depression and self-harm among teenagers spiking dramatically since social media was introduced. “These children are struggling and they need our help,” Ms. Eden said. “I know how hard it is, but we need to be the ones that stand up and say, this is not good for you.”Nova Eden gives her presentation on smartphones and young people at Colindale Primary School, in north London, in February. Ms. Eden, 44, described struggling to find the right balance for her own children, ages 5, 10 and 13. She said it was the campaigning of Ian Russell, whose daughterMolly took her own lifeafter viewing suicide-related content on Instagram and other social media sites, that drove her to get involved. She had just given her own 13-year-old a phone. “At that time, I was going through this with my child, and seeing the change in him and his friends,” she said. Jane Palmer, the principal of the Colindale school, acknowledged that some parents have been skeptical of limiting smartphone use, or of banning the devices from school entirely, as her school will do from September. Some argue the devices can provide social independence and allow them to contact their children in an emergency. Others feel parental controls go far enough in ensuring safety online. “Hopefully what I’m doing is really empowering parents to understand this is so serious now, and we have to stand up to it, and we have to say no to our kids,” says Nova Eden, a regional coordinator for the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign. But the conversations among parents had begun to make way for change, Ms. Palmer said. During the presentation, she described how a former student had died by suicide after being bullied online. “It can be tricky, and of course not everyone is going to support it,” she said of the ban. “But at the end of the day, I think most people just want to keep their children safe.”Colindale is in the borough of Barnet, which in February announced plans to become the firstborough in Britainto ban smartphones in all its public schools.

Euan Ward reported from Beirut, Lebanon. Israel’s Military Strikes Near Beirut, Killing at Least 4The attack on the outskirts of Lebanon’s capital was the second in less than a week, raising fears that a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah could unravel. Israel launched airstrikes on the southern outskirts of Beirut on Tuesday for the second time in less than a week, killing at least four people and prompting fears that a fragile cease-fire could be unraveling. The Israeli military said the strike, in the Dahiya area just south of Beirut, had targeted Hassan Ali Mahmoud Bdeir, a member of Hezbollah and Iran’s elite Quds Force, who had directed and assisted Hamas in planning a “significant and imminent” attack against Israel. It did not provide further details. Hezbollah made no immediate comment on the overnight strike. The airstrikes, which came without an evacuation warning, killed at least four people and wounded several others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, said the attack was a “clear breach” of acease-fire dealbetween Israel and Hezbollah that was agreed to in November. The truce halted Lebanon’s deadliest war in decades, but a recent uptick in violence and tension has stoked concerns of a creeping escalation. Despite the truce, Israel has repeatedly attacked purported Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, while the militant group has so far refrained from responding. Experts say that Hezbollah, battered by the 14-month war with Israel, has little impetus to risk sparking another conflict while it struggles to recover. But Palestinian armed groups like Hamas — a key ally of Hezbollah — also maintain a sizable presence in Lebanon, operating mostly from decades-old refugee camps. During the war in Gaza, these groups intermittently launched rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel. “We expect the Lebanese government to act against the terrorist elements that operate from their territory,” Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said at a briefing on Tuesday. “We see cooperation between Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah on Lebanese soil.”On Friday, the Israeli military alsolaunched airstrikes in the Dahiyaafter telling residents in a densely populated neighborhood there to evacuate. It was the first time since the cease-fire that the Lebanese capital had been targeted. The attack came hours after rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanese territory. Hezbollah denied any involvement in that attack on Israel and said that it remained committed to the cease-fire. The Israeli military said it had targeted a site that stored Hezbollah’s drones; it also attacked targets in southern Lebanon in response to the rocket fire, killing three people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israeli positions in solidarity with Hamas after that group led an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. After nearly a year of low-level fighting, the violence escalated into full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, killing nearly 4,000 people and leaving swaths of Lebanon in ruins. It was Lebanon’s deadliest andmost destructiveconflict since the country’s 15-year civil war ended in 1990. Gabby Sobelmancontributed reporting.

South Korea’s President Will Learn His Fate on Friday,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeach-court.html,2025-04-01T02:17:08Z,World,"The Constitutional Court will announce on Friday whether Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached in December for declaring martial law, will be permanently removed from office or restored to power.",Impeachment; Martial Law; Politics and Government; Constitutions; Decisions and Verdicts,Yoon Suk-yeol,South Korea,,"The impeached president of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, greeting supporters in Seoul last month. Reporting from SeoulSouth Korea’s President Will Learn His Fate on FridayThe Constitutional Court will announce on Friday whether Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached in December for declaring martial law, will be permanently removed from office or restored to power. Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, who wasimpeachedin December overhis failed attemptto impose martial law, will learn Friday whether he will be formally removed from office or returned to power, the nation’s top court said Tuesday. Suspense was building in South Korea as the country waited forthe Constitutional Courtto rule on Mr. Yoon’s fate. He has been suspended from office since the National Assembly impeached him on Dec. 14. In South Korea, the Constitutional Court decides whether an impeached official is removed permanently from office or reinstated. Removing Mr. Yoon would require the votes of six or more of the court’s eight justices; otherwise, he will return to office.​ The court’s decision, which cannot be appealed, is a critical moment in the political upheaval​ that Mr. Yoon unleashed when he declared martial law on Dec. 3. If ​the court removes him, Mr. Yoon will become the second president in South Korean history to leave office through impeachment. (PresidentPark Geun-hyewas the first, in 2017.) The country will quickly shift gears toward a new election; a successor must be chosen within 60 days. If he is reinstated, South Korea’s political crisis is likely to deepen. Mr. Yoon’s attempt to impose martial law angered millions of South Koreans. Even if reinstated, he will resume his presidential duties with his ability to govern considerably weakened. In a statement, the Constitutional Court said it would convene at 11 a.m. Friday to rule on Mr. Yoon’s case. It said it would allow TV stations to broadcast the ruling live. Mr. Yoon wasdetained on Jan. 15on insurrection charges, also connected to his imposition of martial law. The suspense surrounding his future intensified after a Seoul court unexpectedlyreleased him from jailon March 8, saying his detention was procedurally flawed. The court’s decision — and the ​Constitutional Court’s upcoming ruling — do not directly affect the criminal charges, which he has been fighting in a separate trial that began in February. ​A decision by the Constitutional Court to reject his parliamentary impeachment would galvanizeMr. Yoon’s supporters, who have held rallies in Seoul in recent weeks, calling the impeachment and the insurrection charge a “fraud” and demanding his return to office. But it is likely to anger a majority of South Koreans, who want Mr. Yoon to be removed, according to recent surveys. The police have beefed up security measures around the courthouse to guard against violence. Mr. Yoon unexpectedly declared martial law on Dec. 3, calling the opposition-controlled National Assembly a “monster” and a “den of criminals” that had “paralyzed” his government. It was the first time in more than four decades that any leader had tried placing South Korea, an importantUnited States ally, under military rule. The Assembly voted the measure down, forcing Mr. Yoon to rescind the order within hours. But it set off the nation’s worst political crisis in decades. South Koreans, who harbor painful memories of the past military rule, took to the streets by the thousands to call for Mr. Yoon’s ouster. Holed upwith his bodyguards in his fortified residence in central Seoul, Mr. Yoon initially resisted the efforts of criminal investigators ​to detain him. But hesurrenderedon Jan. 15, becoming the first president in South Korean history to face criminal charges while still in office. Prosecutors said that Mr. Yoon committed insurrection during the short-lived imposition of martial law when, they said, he banned all political activities and ordered military commanders to break the Assembly’s doors down “with axes” or “by shooting, if necessary” and “drag out” lawmakers. They said Mr. Yoon sent the troops to seize the Assembly and detain political leaders. The nation watched live-streamed scenes of special forces troops armed with assault rifles storming the Assembly as lawmakers were gathering there to vote against martial law. When Mr. Yoon attended hearings at the Constitutional Court in recent weeks, he vehemently rejected the charge of insurrection and said he hoped to regain office. He said he never intended to neutralize the Parliament or gave orders to arrest political leaders. The troops were sent to the Assembly to “keep order,” he said. In his final argument at the court on Feb. 25, Mr. Yoon said he declared martial law in a “desperate” struggle against the opposition, which he said had ceaselessly undermined his government with its majority power in Parliament. “Who can say our country is not in a national emergency?” he said, citing President Trump’s decision to declarea national emergencyover immigration and send troops to the border with Mexico. Mr. Yoon said South Korea was overrun with spies from North Korea and China. Lawyers who argued for his ouster on behalf of the National Assembly said the claims by Mr. Yoon were fallacious. Letting him return to office would be like allowing “a madman to drive the car again,” said one of the lawyers, Song Doo-hwan. Mr. Yoon’s former defense minister, several military generals and police chiefs are also standing trial on separate criminal charges of helping Mr. Yoon commit insurrection.

Reporting from Dubai, United Arab EmiratesU.A.E. Sentences Three People to Death for Killing an Israeli RabbiEmirati authorities decided on a punishment for the “premeditated murder with terrorist intention” of Rabbi Zvi Kogan but offered no details about the crime. The United Arab Emirates on Monday sentenced three people to death for theabduction and killingof an Israeli Moldovan rabbi last November, a case that raised concerns about the safety of the country’s small but growing Jewish community. The U.A.E.’s state news agency, WAM,reportedthat the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeals’ State Security Chamber decided on the death penalty for the “premeditated murder with terrorist intention” of Rabbi Zvi Kogan. A fourth person was sentenced for aiding in the crime — in what way the government did not say — to a prison term, followed by deportation from the country. The defendant was sentenced to life in prison, but typically that means being released after 20 years or more. The authorities did not disclose the identities of those sentenced, but the U.A.E. Interior Ministrypreviously identifiedthree people accused of murder as Olimboy Tohirovich and Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, both 28, and Azizbek Kamilovich, 33, all Uzbek nationals. State media released photos of them, blindfolded and shackled at the wrists and ankles, after theirextradition from Turkey. “The defendants had tracked and murdered the victim,” WAM said in its report on Monday. “The evidence presented by the State Security Prosecution to the court included the defendants’ detailed confessions to the crimes of murder and kidnapping, along with forensic reports, post-mortem examination findings, details of the instruments used in the crime and witness testimonies.”The report did not quote the authorities offering a motive for the murder of Rabbi Kogan, 28, or any further details about how he was kidnapped and later killed. The rabbi disappeared on Nov. 21 and was last reported seen in Dubai, the most populous of the nation’s seven emirates, according to an Israeli official who spoke to The New York Times at the time. Israeli news outlets reported that his car had been found abandoned in Al Ain, a city in the adjacent emirate of Abu Dhabi, on the border with Oman. His body was found three days later. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel denounced the killing at the time as an “antisemitic terrorist act.”Rabbi Kogan was a dual citizen of Israel and Moldova and hadworked in the Emiratesas part of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a Hasidic branch of Orthodox Judaism that conducts Jewish outreach around the world. He also helped manage the Rimon kosher supermarket in Dubai’s affluent Al Wasl Road neighborhood. This month, the supermarket announced that it was moving and would accept only delivery orders for the time being. The Israeli Embassy and Consulate in the Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sentences. The kidnapping and killing of the rabbi rattled thesmall Jewish populationof the Emirates; estimates of its number range from hundreds to a few thousand. More Israelis and Jews have made the Emirates their home since the country formallyestablished ties with Israelin the 2020 Abraham Accords. Emirati authorities said on Monday that the capital sentences “are automatically subject to appeal” to the criminal division of the Federal Supreme Court. Cases of capital punishment are rare in the Emirates, but executions are carried out promptly after defendants exhaust their appeals.

Marine Le Pen Falls to the Rule of Law and a Great Battle Looms,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/europe/marine-le-pen-embezzelment-democracy.html,2025-03-31T18:12:56Z,World,A court’s conviction of the far-right leader for embezzlement and its ban on her running for office have set off a new crisis for France.,Politics and Government; Decisions and Verdicts; Courts and the Judiciary; Embezzlement; Elections; Democracy (Theory and Philosophy),"Le Pen, Marine; Bardella, Jordan (1995- ); Trump, Donald J",France,National Rally (France); European Parliament,"Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally, leaving her party’s headquarters in Paris on Monday. Marine Le Pen Falls to the Rule of Law and a Great Battle LoomsNews AnalysisA court’s conviction of the far-right leader for embezzlement and its ban on her running for office have set off a new crisis for France. Last year, Marine Le Pen spoke menacingly of the possible fallout from her trial on embezzlement charges. “Tomorrow, potentially, millions and millions of French people will see themselves deprived of their candidate for the presidency.”After acourt disqualified heron Monday from running for public office for five years, those millions of French voters are adrift and angry. France is a democracy governed by the rule of law, as the verdict demonstrated. But it is unclear how far its troubled Fifth Republic can resist an inevitable gale of political protest before the 2027 election. Unlike President Trump, who met with convictions, indictments and criminal cases on the way to his election last year, possibly even benefiting from perceived persecution, Ms. Le Pen could find no political path past the verdict of the French legal system. “The independence of our justice system and the separation of powers stand at the heart of our democracy,” said Valérie Hayer, a centrist lawmaker in the European Parliament. “Nobody is above the law.”That view is certain to come under sustained attack in a global environment where questioning of the legitimacy of legal systems has become frequent — across Europe, but particularly in Mr. Trump’s United States. Mr. Trump has called for the impeachment of judges who rule against him and called them “lunatics.”“When the radical left can’t win via democratic vote, they abuse the legal system to jail their opponents,” Elon Musk, Mr. Trump’s billionaire aide, said after the verdict. Ms. Le Pen during last year’s parliamentary elections. European societies, given their history, are sensitive to the revival of far-right movements. France, like Germany, has a visceral memory of how fragile democratic institutions are and how once the rule of law goes, the way is open to dictatorial power. “After Ms. Le Pen, the next direct target of a big political battle is going to be the rule of law,” said Alain Duhamel, a prominent political scientist. “There will be accusations that this is a government of judges, attacks on our highest court, not just from the National Rally but the center right,” he said, naming Ms. Le Pen’s party. But, he added, “French magistrates are resolutely independent.”Jordan Bardella, Ms. Le Pen’s carefully groomed protégé, pronounced French democracy dead, killed by the court. It is not; and to Mr. Bardella will no doubt fall the task of leading the anti-immigrant party into the election, unless Ms. Le Pen’s appeal overturns her ban in time. At 29, he is young to aspire to the highest office, but he has demonstrated broad appeal and a near-unflappable command of detail. Just how he disentangles his ambitions from Ms. Le Pen’s remains to be seen. Up to now, they have avoided conflict. Ms. Le Pen and Jordan Bardella last year. Across Europe, the far right leaped on the court’s decision. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s hard-right deputy prime minister, said those “who are afraid of voters’ judgment” often seek reassurance from courts’ judgment. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, said that he stood with Ms. Le Pen. In Moscow, Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said, “More and more European capitals have opted for the violation of democratic norms.”Of course, critiques of democracy from President Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia are hardly persuasive. But in this case they overlap significantly with those of the U.S. vice president, JD Vance, who in February attacked European states for trying to stifle the far right in the name of saving democracy. Ms. Le Pen, like it or not, may now become another element in the Vance-Musk case for European democratic failure. The fact is, however, she was convicted, after prolonged investigation and on detailed evidence, of embezzling millions of dollars of European Union funds to pay party staff members with money intended for aides to European lawmakers. Over the past decade, Ms. Le Pen led a campaign of “de-demonization,” shifting her National Rally party from its fascist antisemitic roots to an anti-immigrant mainstream party that has more seats in the National Assembly than any other. She could now direct the party to make trouble. Ms. Le Pen at the National Assembly last month. The most direct means would be to overturn the centrist government of Prime Minister François Bayrou by supporting a no-confidence motion this year, in effect saying to the French people that they should be the judges and issue their verdict in a parliamentary election. A major swing to the National Rally would not open the way for Ms. Le Pen to become president, but it would be a powerful statement. If there is a parliamentary election, which can be held after June, Ms. Le Pen could not defend her current seat, but nothing would prevent her from becoming prime minister if the National Rally won big. “The tribunal demonstrated its political will, not legal but political,” said Wallerand de Saint-Just, a former party treasurer who was also convicted. Not so, said a host of centrist politicians, who have made their pride in the French legal system clear as Mr. Trump attacks a supposedly “weaponized” American judiciary. “Madame Le Pen, whether elected or a candidate, is a French citizen,” said Sacha Houlié, a center-left lawmaker. “The law of the Republic applies.”Marine Le PenGun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Reporting from LondonWhat We Know About the Dispute at Prince Harry’s CharityHarry resigned from Sentebale, the charity he co-founded in memory of his mother, after a dispute erupted between the charity’s chair, Sophie Chandauka, and five of its trustees. Prince Harry announced on March 25 that he hadstepped downas a patron of Sentebale, the charity he co-founded in memory of his mother, after a monthslong dispute between the charity’s chair and the board of trustees broke into the open. Harry and his fellow co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, said they had quit in solidarity with five board members who had resigned over a dispute with the chair, Sophie Chandauka. Both Ms. Chandauka and the group of former trustees have made allegations of wrongdoing against each other, and both parties said they had submitted claims and evidence of their arguments to Britain’s Charity Commission. Here’s what we know. Why did Prince Harry resign from the charity? Harry founded the charity with Prince Seeiso in 2006. In recent months, the organization’s leadership has been at loggerheads. The five trustees who resigned — Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West — said in a joint statement that they had called on the board’s chair, Ms. Chandauka, to resign from her position, after losing “trust and confidence” in her. They said that Ms. Chandauka, who was appointed in 2023, responded by filing a lawsuit in Britain “to block us from voting her out,” and that they were resigning to avoid burdening the charity with the cost of the suit. “We could not in good conscience allow Sentebale to undertake that legal and financial burden and have been left with no other option but to vacate our positions,” the former trustees said in their statement. “This was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity.”Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso said in their statement that the former trustees had “acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down.” They added: “What’s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale’s beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”From left, Sophie Chandauka, Sentebale’s chair; Argentinian polo player Nacho Figueras; Prince Harry and the former All Blacks rugby player Dan Carter at a Sentebale charity event in Singapore in 2023. What are Ms. Chandauka’s accusations against the former trustees and Prince Harry? Ms. Chandauka said in a statement about the former trustees that she had acted to expose what she described as “issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir and the coverup that ensued.”  (Misogynoir is a term referring to pointed sexism toward Black women.) In addition to filing a case in an English court, she said, she had reported the trustees to Britain’s Charity Commission. After the five trustees stepped down, Ms. Chandauka immediately appointed four new trustees. In interviews with the British news media, Ms. Chandauka has sinceaccused the princeof engaging in harassment and bullying to try to force her out of her post. A spokesman for Harry declined to comment on her latest claims. Despite her allegations, Ms. Chandauka said her relationship with Harry had been “fantastic, actually.” But she said, “There are some individuals on the board who thought they could get away with mistreating a woman.”What is Sentebale? Harry established Sentebale with Prince Seeiso, the younger brother of King Letsie III of Lesotho, in 2006. Founded in honor of Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Seeiso’s mother, the charity raised funds for communities affected by the H.I.V. pandemic in Lesotho, a small landlocked kingdom that is one of the world’s poorest countries. In 2019, it expanded its work into nearby Botswana, and to addressing substance abuse, gender-based violence and other social ills among young people. What happens next? Both sides have filed claims of wrongdoing with Britain’s Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales. Although Sentebale operates in southern Africa, it is registered in Britain. A spokeswoman for the Charity Commission said that the regulator was “assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

A French criminal court ruled that Ms. Le Pen played a “central role” in an illegal scheme by the party, when it was still called the National Front, to use the equivalent of almost $5 million of European Parliament funds for party expenses between 2004 and 2016. The party was short of cash at the time, and Ms. Le Pen was a member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2017.The court found that the party used European Parliament funds to pay assistants to National Front members of the body for work that was unrelated to E.U. business. The judges rejected Ms. Le Pen’s argument that it was appropriate for the assistants to do party-related work... Ms. Le Pen left the court before the full verdict was read out and did not address reporters as she departed.The ruling does not strip her of her seat in the National Assembly, but Ms. Le Pen will only be able to run for president in 2027 if she secures a more favorable ruling on appeal before the deadline to enter the race. But even a successful appeal could take some time.The court also ruled that the National Rally had to pay a 2 million euro fine, half of which would be suspended.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen leaving the courtroom in Paris Monday. Amelia Nierenberg reported from London, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris. What We Know About Marine Le Pen’s Embezzlement ConvictionThe far-right French politician was a leading candidate to become the country’s next president, but has now been barred from running for public office for five years. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far right and a leading candidate to become the country’s next president, has beenbarredfrom running for public office for five years, after she and her party were convicted of embezzling millions of euros of European Union funds. Ms. Le Pen, an anti-immigrant, populist politician, was also sentenced to four years in prison — with two years suspended and two that could be served under house arrest — and fined 100,000 euros, or about $108,000. She has consistently denied any wrongdoing and will appeal the verdict, which would put her jail sentence and the fine on hold. But the ruling against Ms. Le Pen and her party, the National Rally, threatens to ruin her plans to run for the presidency in 2027. She has spent years trying to soften her party’s image and move it into the mainstream by disavowing its antisemitic roots after expelling her father from the far-right party he once led. Who is Marine Le Pen? Ms. Le Pen, 56, became the face of France’s far right after taking over the party in 2011 from her father,Jean-Marie Le Pen. Ms. Le Pen has sought todetoxify the political movementhe built by softening some of its policies, changing the name of the party from the National Front to the National Rally, publicly rejecting her father’s antisemitism — he was convicted by a French court of Holocaust denial for saying that the Nazi gas chambers were a “detail” of history — and trying to court disaffected voters. Marine Le Pen, flanked by her late father Jean-Marie Le Pen, speaking in 2012. But even if the tone has changed, Ms. Le Pen’s platform is still staunchly hard right. Her policies include using severe measures to curb immigration and pushing for French-born citizens to have more rights to social benefits and other areas of state support, even though some argue that this could violate the French Constitution. Ms. Le Pen has run for the country’s highest office three times, and although she has yet to win she has succeeded in steadily increasing her share of the vote and expanding her party’s reach. In the last presidential election in 2022, she won 41.5 percent of the vote, up from 33.9 percent in the previous election five years earlier. Last year, the National Rally became the biggest single party in the National Assembly, the country’s lower house of Parliament, for the first time. What were the charges? A French criminal court ruled that Ms. Le Pen played a “central role” in an illegal scheme by the party, when it was still called the National Front, touse the equivalent of almost $5 millionof European Parliament funds for party expenses between 2004 and 2016. The party was short of cash at the time, and Ms. Le Pen was a member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2017. The court found that the party used European Parliament funds to pay assistants to National Front members of the body for work that was unrelated to E.U. business. The judges rejected Ms. Le Pen’s argument that it was appropriate for the assistants to do party-related work. Bénédicte de Perthuis, the presiding judge, called the ban necessary because of the seriousness of the charges and the fact that the accused seemed unwilling to acknowledge the facts. The court has to “ensure that elected officials, like any citizen, do not benefit from any favorable treatment,” she said. Ms. Le Pen has called the case a political witch hunt. On Monday night, she told TF1 television that the ruling was an attempt to thwart her. “I’m not going to submit to a democratic denial so easily,” she said. What’s next for Ms. Le Pen and her party? Ms. Le Pen left the court before the full verdict was read out and did not address reporters as she departed. The ruling does not strip her of her seat in the National Assembly, but Ms. Le Pen will only be able to run for president in 2027 if she secures a more favorable ruling on appeal before the deadline to enter the race. But even a successful appeal could take some time. The court also ruled that the National Rally had to pay a 2 million euro fine, half of which would be suspended. Twenty-three other people were convicted on charges related to the scheme to embezzle European Parliament funds. The ruling does not bar Jordan Bardella, Ms. Le Pen’s 29-year-old protégé, from running for president in her absence. He is seen as the leading alternative candidate. Where does this leave France? France’s President Emmanuel Macron in Paris last week. The judgment against Ms. Le Pen could reignite the political chaos that roiled France last year after Mr. Macron called snap elections. The ruling couldreignite the political chaosthat roiled France last year after President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections. The French government is not popular, and struggled to pass a budget this year. It could be toppled by lawmakers in the National Assembly.

Reporting from BangkokThey Found Love at a Construction Site, Then Were Trapped Beneath ItThe Bangkok building razed by Friday’s quake employed men and women who had found love at work. Despite glimmers of hope, many were still beneath the rubble. The rescue teams at the collapsed office tower in Bangkok thought they’d found a miracle on Sunday night: a channel into the basement, leading to a wide-open space where workers still unaccounted for might have lived through Friday’s giant earthquake. “We thought for sure we’d find someone,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, chief of operations for the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, one of Thailand’s leading emergency organizations. “It was a whole room. It was big.”Around a dozen rescuers stepped in. They were from Thailand, China, the United States and Israel. They could see the foundation’s pillars holding strong. But the room was empty. The next morning, another wisp of hope arrived when infrared sensors found potential signs of life. The recovery work fell silent. But after a while, there was nothing. No one was pulled out alive or dead on Monday by the time the clock ticked past the so-called golden window — the 72 hours in which survival is most likely. “Hope is dimming,” Mr. Piyalux said. “We’re very disappointed.”Was rescue becoming recovery? Not officially. Around 80 workers were still under the pile of chest-crushing rubble and steel that was tall enough to be seen from blocks away. Rescue workers said they were racing against time, as if 72 hours really meant 96, or maybe more. Family members and acquaintances of the missing waited for news on Monday. The building had been partially finished, at a stage where the interior work involved what employees described as roughly an even mix of male and female workers. Many were in love. Husbands and wives, married for years, worked with young couples in fevered courtships. Perhaps that’s why the sights and sounds on Monday seemed more urgent. After mostly probing the pile, to avoid disruption and to ensure a careful first sweep for life, a half dozen excavators pinched and punched at the edges all at once, their tweezerlike fingers grabbing at steel and concrete in a haphazard dance. Maybe, deeper in, more signs of life would emerge. Apichat Chaihlao, 32, said he was waiting for his girlfriend. Her name was Nayana Phimsan, and she was just 18. They were there together on Friday, for their first day of work after moving from another job. After lunch, he was a few floors away, smoking, when he felt dizzy, saw the building swaying and ran out. A few of his friends didn’t make it. “As long as they have not found them, I’ll believe she is still alive,” he said. He described Ms. Nayana as strong and full of life, with a great sense of humor. “I like to annoy her, tease her until she yells at me,” he said. “Now it’s so empty,” he added. “I don’t want to go home at all.”Nearby, Samai Lapphet, 65, said he would keep an open mind until the end of the week — maybe his eldest son, Kittisuk, 40, an electrician, had survived. Kittisuk had met his girlfriend there at work. She was stuck in the ruins, too. They were supposed to marry. “The most important thing is for him to be found,” Mr. Samai said, “so I can see him again.”Waiting for news was now a team effort. Many submitted DNA samples to the police so that remains of relatives could be identified, even if very little could be found. Mothers at the site were joined by brothers, cousins, uncles and friends. On the sidewalk, two teenage girls sat on cardboard and tried to comfort older relatives. In a park, a half-dozen men with connections to someone at the work site gathered on a blanket with a pink pillow covered in cartoon kittens. Each group helping with rescue operations wore different uniforms, including the police, in blue. All around them, the street where the building entrance would have been had become a community. Tents had multiplied with volunteer assistance, with food for relatives, pallets of water for rescuers and the occasional mental health worker offering support. Each group wore a different uniform: firefighters in red and the police in blue. Mr. Thinkaew and his team wore green jumpsuits with gold lettering. Others wore neon orange or yellow. The main color to be found, the color that defined everything, was gray, as dust settled on everything and everyone. Something as solid as a giant tower had been reduced to particles, pulled into lungs and eyes with the smell of pulverized concrete. Somewhere in there, though, were loved ones. Under a sky blue tarp with a view of tangled steel, Supattra Penjan, 40, dabbed her eyes with a white washcloth. Her son, Worawut Triwut, was 18, she said, a recent graduate, a joker, a lover of soccer. She showed us a photo taken at 7:32 a.m. on the day of the earthquake. He looked happy in his orange vest, his hair combed back, standing near his best friend and co-worker. He’d been working at the building for a week. “As a mom, I keep this hope in me that he is still alive,” she said. “But I am also starting to prepare myself for the worst.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Russian drones are bombarding Ukrainian cities with intense frequency and ferocity. Paul Sonne reported from Berlin and Marc Santora from Kyiv, Ukraine. Putin Keeps Pushing, With Trump and on the BattlefieldNews AnalysisThe Russian leader’s drones are deluging Ukrainian cities, while his negotiating tactics test the patience of the friendliest White House he has faced in decades. The White House, for two months, has warmly embraced the Kremlin. But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has given little in return, despite his professed willingness to cooperate. His forces have carried on bombarding Ukraine, both on the front and deep into the Ukrainian heartland. He has barely budged in peace negotiations, freighting an agreement to an unconditional 30-day cease-fire with myriad conditions. His subordinateshave dragged out talks, voicing requirements for a limited Black Sea truce in recent days. Then, during an Arctic appearance late last week, Mr. Putin suggested a temporary Ukrainian government might need to be installed under the auspices of the United Nations and an election might need to be held to pave the way for a lasting end to the war. The implication was that a quick peace would not be in the offing, with Mr. Putin again suggesting he couldn’t cut a deal with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, whom Moscow for monthshas been tarnishing as illegitimate. President Trump took notice. The U.S. president told NBC News this weekend that he was “very angry” about the comments and threatened to impose tariffs on any country buying Russian oil, a measure that could dent Moscow’s most crucial source of income for the war. “If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Mr. Trump said. Civilians who fled Kostiantynivka, Ukraine, arriving at a humanitarian hub this month. The result is a question of increasing relevance for the most Russia-friendly American administration in decades: Is Washington prepared to pile pressure on Mr. Putin, whose authoritarian power, disregard for term limits and crusade against liberals have long appealed to Mr. Trump? “I think Trump wants so much a deal with Putin that he will not immediately go in the other direction and put Russia under pressure,” said Stefan Meister, a Russia expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “But I think we are moving closer to a turning point, where Trump understands that Putin might not have an interest in any deal and all the time will put something additional on the table of what he wants to get.”On the battlefield, there is no sign Mr. Putin intends to back off. Russian drones are bombarding Ukrainian cities with intense frequency and ferocity. In recent weeks, the attacks have taken on a deadly pattern as Russia concentrates a blizzard of drones, many armed with powerful thermobaric warheads, on different population centers. Russian forces are preparing to launch yet another large-scale offensive, Ukrainian commandershave warned, amid intense fighting across the front. Mr. Putin, far from seeing a conflict that has reached a standstill, is boasting that his army is preparing to“finish off”the Ukrainian military. “There are reasons to believe that we will finish them off,” Mr. Putinsaidduring a visit to a nuclear-powered submarine in Murmansk. Russia, he claimed, is “moving toward achieving all the goals stated at the beginning of the special operation.”Those goals ultimately amount to bringing Ukraine back under Moscow’s thumb. Despite bristling about Mr. Trump’sdemand for rights to its minerals, Ukraine has agreed to every cease-fire proposal the Trump administration has put forward to stem the violence — from anunconditional 30-daypause on strikes on energy infrastructure to a cessation of violence on the Black Sea. The efforts have won Kyiv only so much good will in Washington, now run largely by leaders skeptical of Ukraine. A neighborhood hit by a Russian strike in Kramatorsk last month. Mr. Trump also threatened Mr. Zelensky over the weekend, accusing the Ukrainian leader of trying to back out of the deal to give the U.S. mineral rights as compensation for American aid. “He’s trying to back out of the rare earth deal and if he does that he’s got some problems, big, big problems,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday on Air Force One. Mr. Putin has long questioned Ukraine’s sovereignty, and the U.S. government said his invasion of Ukraine in 2022 aimed to topple Mr. Zelensky’s government. Mr. Putin seemed to reiterate that goal on Friday, calling for a “temporary international administration” to be installed. As Mr. Putin is adding to his list of demands, Russian drone strikes continue unabated. In recent days, Russia hit a hotel complex in Dnipro in central Ukraine, killing four civilians and injuring some two dozen people, as well as hospital and residential homes in Kharkiv, killing two and injuring more than 50. “The geography and brutality of Russian strikes, not just occasionally, but every day and night, show that Putin couldn’t care less about diplomacy,” Mr. Zelensky said on Sunday night. “For several weeks now, there has been a U.S. proposal for an unconditional cease-fire. And almost every day, in response to this proposal, there are Russian drones, bombs, artillery shelling and ballistic strikes.”The Trump administration has so far declined to take any significant action to pressure Russia. Mr. Trump has declined to acknowledge that it was Russia that started the war, falsely declared Mr. Zelensky a “dictator,” andbriefly suspendedAmerican military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a disastrous meeting in the Oval Office. At the same time, the White House has taken steps that benefit the Kremlin, includinghalting the workof several U.S. security agencies to counterRussian sabotage,disinformationandcyberwarfaredisbandingan F.B.I. team that seized the assets of Russian oligarchs and dismantling organizations that Moscow has long loathed, including the aid agency U.S.A.I.D. Mr. Trump said that he planned to speak to Mr. Putin again this week. His threat to impose new punitive measures against Russia followed several hours playing golf with President Alexander Stubb of Finland, a staunch supporter of Ukraine. After the meeting, Mr. Stubb said at a news conference in London that he suggested Mr. Trump set a deadline for Russia to accept an unconditional cease-fire — April 20, which is Easter Sunday. The funeral of Vasyl Ratushnyi, 28, a Ukrainian service member, in Kyiv’s Maidan Square this month. The limited agreement by both Russia and Ukraine to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days, which contained no enforcement mechanism, appears to be falling apart. Both sides have already accused the other of violating the deal. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on Monday that there was no scheduled call between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump this week but said one could be set up “very quickly.” Mr. Peskov downplayed Mr. Trump’s oil threat, and said that Russia was continuing to work with the United States. Mr. Trump has made threats against Russia before, writing on Truth Social in January that Mr. Putin needed to “settle now and stop this ridiculous war” and warning the Russian leader “we can do it the easy way, or the hard way.”The U.S. president’s first administration, filled with Russia hawks, signed off on measures that challenged Moscow. But his second is missing many of those figures, apart from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who in the past has pushed for a muscular approach to Russia. Mr. Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would end the conflict within 24 hours of becoming president. Mr. Putin’s comments made peace seem further away, raising questions about what the American leader will do if he realizes he has hit a wall in his negotiations with Moscow. “It is an illusion from Trump’s camp that Putin will supply what they want,” Mr. Meister said. “Putin has completely different interests. There is no overlap. It is a construct in a way from the Trump camp, and they will learn it hard.”Black Sea Cease-Fire: Ukrainian Navy officers and business owners in Odesa, a port city,pondered what Kyiv could gain from a truceafter it pushed back Russian vessels and resumed commercial shipping.

Reporting from BangkokMyanmar Quake Death Toll Tops 2,000 as Help Comes Slowly for War-Torn CityAs deaths mount, some volunteers complained of being blocked by Myanmar’s military from reaching a rebel stronghold that was badly hit. Three days after Myanmar’s worst earthquake in more than a century ravaged the remote, war-torn city of Sagaing, razing monasteries and apartment buildings, help was still just starting to trickle in. The city’s 300,000 residents had been left to largely fend for themselves afterthe 7.7-magnitude quakestruck, damaging roads and prompting the authorities to close a bridge over safety concerns. The area was already deeply isolated, cut off from the internet by Myanmar’s military, which has been fighting rebels in a civil war. By late Monday, some international aid groups began arriving in Sagaing. But local volunteers seeking to help with search and rescue efforts said they were being blocked by the military. “We are not allowed to freely enter and provide assistance,” said U Tin Shwe, a resident of Sagaing who was standing outside a military barricade at a monastery that had toppled, with monks still trapped under the debris. “Rescue operations can only be carried out with their permission.”The military government said on Monday that the toll from the earthquake, which ripped through large swaths of Myanmar, including Sagaing, and the cities of Mandalay and Naypyidaw, had surged to 2,056, up from around 1,700 on Saturday. An additional 3,900 were injured. Preliminary modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggests the number of deaths could be more than 10,000. Search-and-rescue teams have flocked to the cities of Mandalay and Naypyidaw, the home of the country’s generals. But many people in Myanmar have taken to social media to plead with foreign governments to redirect aid into Sagaing, which was close to the quake’s epicenter and where residents say that over 80 percent of the town has been destroyed. In Sagaing on Monday, soldiers kept watch at checkpoints but were not seen helping to search for survivors. With no space left in the main hospital in the city, people wrapped their dead in white cloth and laid them on the concrete outside. Hundreds of residents were stranded on the streets, sleeping under plastic tarps with no power, and food and water that is quickly running out. The disaster was so bad that it prompted the junta to make a rare call for international aid. But it is clear that such aid will only be allowed in on the junta’s own terms. Since the earthquake, countless trucks carrying aid have been stuck overnight at military checkpoints in the city, according to the Centre for Ah Nyar Studies, an independent, nonprofit based in central Myanmar. Then on Monday, a 50-member trauma response team from Malaysia entered Sagaing, the first foreign rescue team to do so, according to local media. Destruction in Myanmar and ThailandIn Photos and VideosMyanmar’s military regime, headed bySenior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has been battling rebel forces for control of Sagaing since it seized power in a coup four years ago. Scrappy groups of ordinary citizens who took up arms against the junta have made it a stronghold of resistance, and the junta has responded with a sustained campaign of airstrikes, beheadings and arson. In the past year, the rebel fighters, who have received training from some of Myanmar’s ethnic armies, have notched significant gains against the military. Doctors belonging to the Civil Disobedience Movement, made up of government workers who left their jobs following the coup, have been blocked from entering Sagaing, according to Dr. Wai Zan, who works at the Sagaing General Hospital. “The military is conducting security checks everywhere, making it impossible for them to enter,” Dr. Wai Zan said. Troops have set up military checkpoints in Sagaing to control access to the city, which was mostly destroyed by the earthquake. The broader Sagaing region, in central Myanmar, with about five million people including in the city proper, is home to the country’s Bamar Buddhist majority. It sits between two rivers — the Irrawaddy to the east and the Chindwin to the west — that serve as vital routes for the army’s transportation of goods, people and military supplies. Even before the earthquake, Sagaing was at the center of much suffering. The region has borne the brunt of military airstrikes in the country. And it accounts for the biggest number of internally displaced people in Myanmar, tallying more than one million, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Even before the quake, at least 27 townships in Sagaing region already lacked access to clean water and power, according to the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar, an independent research group. More than half of the houses and buildings in Myanmar that have been destroyed by the civil war were in this region. “Really extreme violence was carried out: beheadings, dismemberment and different sorts of violent displays meant to intimidate the population,” said Morgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The aftermath of the earthquake offered reminders of the city’s isolation. Win Mar said that when the earthquake struck, she was sitting outside her house, which “crumbled entirely, with bricks falling one by one.” Her husband and her 16-year-old daughter were trapped inside and died, but it was not until Sunday that volunteers from Mandalay managed to pull their bodies out. “I have lost everything, my family and my home,” she said. Because the internet has been cut off since the coup and phone signals are weak, Sagaing residents could not tell the outside world what was happening. The city is overrun by soldiers and militia who closely monitor arrivals of people and aid. “Nothing is really getting there,” said Joe Freeman, Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher. “We are mainly worried about aid being blocked by the military because it is their history and pattern.”A sign at the bridge to Sagaing on Monday reads: “All the rescue vehicles coming to Sagaing must report at the checkpoint.”Thant Zin, a volunteer trying to help in Sagaing, said aid “efforts are ineffective because we are working with bare hands, without the necessary equipment.”“Many of the people trapped under collapsed houses are already dead,” he said. “Right now, what we need most is to recover dead bodies.”Getting aid to the city has been challenging because the military closed the main bridge connecting Mandalay and Sagaing, out of safety concerns, after another bridge, a British colonial-era one, collapsed following the quake. The authorities reopened the main bridge on Sunday, but directed rescue vehicles entering Sagaing to a checkpoint. Cars and trucks have been unable to pass along damaged roads. The World Food Program, which expected to start distributing food to 17,000 people in Sagaing starting Monday, had to go by ferry. The agency plans to help 1 million people in conflict zones around the country in the coming weeks, according to Melissa Hein, head of communications for the World Food Program in Myanmar. On Monday afternoon, a team fromUnicef, the United Nations agency for children, arrived in Sagaing after a 13-hour drive from Yangon to Mandalay, according to Trevor Clark, the agency’s regional emergency adviser. He said that so far, the agency’s workers had not encountered any trouble at checkpoints."

The latest wave of displacement followed theTaliban’s takeover of Afghanistanin August 2021, after the collapse of Ashraf Ghani’s U.S.-backed government. They included refugees who were promised resettlement in the United States. Many now face mandatory repatriation, with a March 31 deadline — a decision that was announced only last month, sparking widespread fear. “As a fellow Muslim nation and a neighbor, Pakistan should show compassion and grant refugees more time to prepare,” said Haji Abdullah Bukhari, a community leader in Karachi. “Uprooting their lives in just a few days is impossible. Many have spent decades here, and now they are being forced to return to a country they barely know.”Pakistan’s ongoing deportation of Afghan refugees stems from growing frustration with the Taliban administration, which it accuses of sheltering Pakistani militants, particularly Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or T.T.P.,responsible for deadly attacks inside Pakistan. The Taliban deny these allegations, but tensions continue to rise. In 2023, Pakistanexpelled hundreds of thousands of Afghans— both documented and undocumented. However, most refugees awaiting resettlement in Western countries were largely spared thanks to diplomatic interventions. Their fate, however, became increasingly uncertain in January when President Trump issued an executive ordersuspending all refugee admissionsto the United States. This decision left thousands of Afghansstranded in Pakistan. In February, Pakistan announced its plans to repatriate Afghans awaiting resettlement by March 31, along with 800,000 Pakistan-issued Afghan Citizenship Card holders and an unknown number of undocumented Afghan migrants. The decision has caused widespread unease, particularly among those most vulnerable to Taliban persecution, including former Afghan government and security officials, women’s rights activists and journalists. “Many have told us they fear prison, torture, or even execution if Pakistan forcibly sends them back to Afghanistan,” said Moniza Kakar, a lawyer withthe Joint Action Committee for Refugees, a Pakistani civil society network that advocates for international intervention and support to safeguard lives. Avaaz, a global campaign that is currently working to support a group of 60 Afghan women’s rights activists stuck in Pakistan, has also voiced deep concern over the deportation drive. Among those affected is Samia Hamza, a women’s rights activist and former law and international relations student under the U.S.-fundedDenton Program. After the Taliban seized power, she protested against the ban on girls’ education, further endangering herself. As conditions worsened in late 2021, shefled to Pakistan. However, she has since faced severe discrimination and economic hardship while awaiting U.S. resettlement through thespecial immigration visas for Afghansprogram. Like many Afghans, she was devastated by the Trump administration’s decision to halt new immigrants. “We have heard nothing about our case since then,” said Hamza, who lives with her husband and four children in Islamabad. “With the threat of deportation, returning to Afghanistan means facing grave danger.”The Pakistani government has ruled out extending the deportation deadline despite appeals frominternational organizationsand the Taliban administration. Justifying its crackdown on Afghans, the government has drawn parallels to ongoing deportation efforts in the United States and various European countries. Meanwhile, Philippa Candler, the Pakistan representative at the United Nations refugee agency,  urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure voluntary, safe returns. “Forced returns help no one and aren’t sustainable — many deported in 2023 have already returned.”Many Afghans rememberterrifying scenes of the 2023 expulsions, dreading the moment when police contingents might arrive — knocking on doors, rounding up families into trucks and transferring them to detention centers before forcing them into Afghanistan. “We are all praying for a miracle that Pakistan will stop the deportations to a country my children have never seen,” said Naik Bakht, an Afghan refugee who arrived in Karachi in 1996. A father of three, all born in Pakistan, he said he fears for their future. “I am terrified. What will we do in Afghanistan? Where will we go? How will we survive?”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Adam Rasgon reported from Jerusalem, and Ameera Harouda reported from Doha, QatarIsrael Issues Wide-Ranging Evacuation Order for Southern GazaThe order, which came during the Eid al-Fitr holiday, included Rafah and parts of neighboring Khan Younis. The Israeli military issued a sweeping evacuation order for the southern Gaza Strip on Monday, signaling that it could relaunch intensive assaults in the area. The order, which came during the Eid al-Fitr holiday, heralded renewed hardship for Palestinians in the southernmost city of Rafah, which has been battered by the war between Israel and Hamas. The city has endured periods of being overwhelmed with displaced people and of being depopulated by evacuation orders. The warrestarted two weeks agoafter a monthslong cease-fire collapsed. In the past, the Israeli military has ordered evacuations before both aerial attacks and ground maneuvers that it has said were targeting Hamas. Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman, on Monday posted a map of the affected areas on his social media accounts, including Rafah and parts of neighboring Khan Younis. He said Palestinians must relocate to shelters in a coastal region to the north. Israel’s military “is returning to fighting with great force to take out the capabilities of terrorists organizations in these areas,” he wrote. This month, Mr. Adraee announced an evacuation order for some neighborhoods in Rafah, and the maps he posted on Monday again included those. It was not clear how many people were still in Rafah when Mr. Adraee made his post and how many intended to follow his instructions. While hundreds of thousands of people lived there before the war, wide swaths of the city have since been reduced to rubble. Over the past two weeks, Mr. Adraee hasissued evacuation ordersfor other parts of Gaza, but many residents of those areas have seemingly ignored them. Since the start of the war ignited by the Hamas-led October 2023 attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza have been repeatedly displaced by the fighting — a miserable experience that has forced many people to live in crowded makeshift shelters next to strangers. The Israeli military resumed its attacks against Hamas in Gaza on March 18, after Israel and Hamas failed to reach an agreement to extend a cease-fire that started in January. Israel and Hamas have been speaking to mediators abouta potential dealto restore the cease-fire, but a breakthrough has not been achieved. In the past, the Israeli military has ordered evacuations before both aerial attacks and ground incursions that it has said were targeting Hamas. Photos posted on social media showed a succession of people fleeing Rafah on foot while carrying bags of belongings. Hazem Haniyeh, an official in the Gaza-based office of the Independent Commission for Human Rights, said that the displacement from Rafah was particularly challenging for people still looking for a new place to stay. “This decision has exacerbated the suffering of the people,” he said, adding that some, especially those with disabilities, were struggling to leave the city. With a shortage of fuel, the cost of a ride to the north is out of reach for many families. ّWafa Abu Duba, 43, a resident of Rafah, said she was getting used to living in a home with her mother, sister and children but now had no idea where to go. “Our lives are shattered,” she said. “Where will I go now with my children? We have no food, no money, no essentials for survival,” she added. “Who will help us? Where will we find food and money?”Ms. Abu Duba expressed frustration that the Israeli military was continuing its offensive in Gaza, but she also accused Hamas of giving Israel a pretext to wage war, with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack. “May God avenge Hamas,” she said. Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints: President Trump is more aligned than his predecessoron Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition.

She was defeated in three successive presidential elections, in 2012, 2017 and 2022. Reporting from ParisMarine Le Pen Barred From French Presidential Run After Embezzlement RulingThe sentence made the far-right leader ineligible for five years, excluding her from the 2027 election unless she can secure a more favorable outcome on appeal. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, was found guilty of embezzlement by a criminal court in Paris on Monday and immediately barred from running for public office for five years, setting off a democratic crisis in France. The verdict effectively barred the current front-runner in the 2027 presidential election from participating in it, an extraordinary step but one the presiding judge said was necessary because nobody is entitled to “immunity in violation of the rule of law.”Jordan Bardella, Ms. Le Pen’s protégé and a likely presidential candidate in her absence,said on social media, “Not only has Marine Le Pen been unjustly convicted; French democracy has been executed.” Hard-right leaders across Europe, including Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, appeared to agree. “Je suis Marine!”Mr. Orban declared. However, Sacha Houlié, a centrist lawmaker,asked, “Is our society really so sick that we are going to take offense at what is no more and no less than the rule of law?”The verdict infuriated Ms. Le Pen, an anti-immigrant, nationalist politician who has already mounted three failed presidential bids. Murmuring “incredible,” she briskly left the courtroom before the hearing was over. Ms. Le Pen, looking grim, told TF1 television that the ruling was a “political” attempt to thwart her. She said that millions of French people were “outraged,” and she vowed to fight back despite slim chances of legal success. “Let’s be clear,” she said. “I am eliminated, but in reality it’s millions of French people whose voices have been eliminated.”“I’m not going to submit to a democratic denial so easily,” Ms. Le Pen added angrily, displaying little of the “serenity” that she had spoken of before the verdict. Anopinion pollon the presidential election published on Sunday gave Ms. Le Pen 34 to 37 percent of the vote, more than 10 points ahead of her nearest rival. President Emmanuel Macron is term-limited and cannot run again. Ms. Le Pen has denied any wrongdoing in the case, which involved accusations that her party, the National Rally,misused several million eurosin European Parliament funds between 2004 and 2016. Ms. Le Pen was found guilty not of personally enriching herself but of overseeing a complex scheme to pay party staff members with money intended for aides to European lawmakers. The court also sentenced Ms. Le Pen, 56, to four years in prison, with two of those years suspended. The court said the other two could be served under a form of house arrest. She was fined 100,000 euros, or about $108,000. Ms. Le Pen’s electoral ineligibility is effective immediately. As a result, she will be able to run in 2027 only if she secures a more lenient ruling on appeal — which is difficult but not impossible. The appeals process is slow in France. The presiding judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, acknowledged that a politician prevented from running for office might later win on appeal, and she said the tribunal could not be indifferent to “the need to seek social consensus.”But the gravity of the case, and the apparent refusal of those accused to acknowledge the facts, made political disqualification necessary, the judge said. The court has to “ensure that elected officials, like any citizen, do not benefit from any favorable treatment,” she noted. The verdict could usher in a period of renewed political turmoil if Ms. Le Pen decides to lash out againstFrance’s fragile governmentor if anger spills over into the streets. The government struggled to pass a budget this year and could still be toppled at any time by lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament, where Ms. Le Pen’s party is the single largest. The verdict does not affect her current mandate as a lawmaker in the lower house. But if Mr. Macron calls snap elections, as he did last year, she will not be eligible to run again. Given the current impasse in a divided assembly, such a dissolution this year is plausible. Until Monday, the accusations that Ms. Le Pen and her party had embezzled a sum close to $5 million in European Parliament funds had done little to hinder theNational Rally’s risefrom the fringes of French politics to its heart. Ms. Le Pen has endeavored torebrand the party, founded in 1972 by her father,Jean-Marie Le Pen, steering it away from its antisemitic and racist roots. Its platform, however, has remained resolutely hard right, calling for extreme toughness on crime and drastic measures against immigration. The court ruled that Ms. Le Pen had played a “central role” in the scheme to siphon funds from the European Parliament and to fill up its coffers at a time when they were precariously empty. Ms. Le Pen was a European lawmaker from 2004 to 2017. The party used lawmaker assistants who were paid with European Parliament funds to perform tasks for the party that were unrelated to E.U. business, the court ruled. It also rejected Ms. Le Pen’s argument that the case was a political witch hunt. “No one is on trial for engaging in politics,” Judge de Perthuis said.

Michael Schwirtz and James Hill spent 14 hours aboard a French naval plane as it patrolled the Baltic Sea, monitored commercial shipping lanes and came into close contact with Russian warships. A NATO Plane’s Busy Duty: Tracking (and Dodging) Russia in the Baltic SeaThe assignment was part of a new program aimed at suspected Russian sabotage. None has occurred since NATO began patrols. The French naval patrol plane descended rapidly through the clouds, leveling off at 900 feet above the Baltic Sea, practically skimming the waves. The target was a Russian warship, which came into view off the plane’s port side, dark gray against a light gray horizon. The aircraft, an Atlantique 2 of the French Navy, was designed to hunt submarines and other enemy naval craft, but on this day its torpedo bay was empty and its only weapons were a high-resolution camera and other sophisticated surveillance instruments. The goal was to observe, and be seen observing. “We are to show that we are here,” said Romain, a lieutenant commander and a member of the plane’s crew. Never fully tranquil, the Baltic Sea, with a coastline heavily militarized by Northern European and Russian navies, has become an increasingly tense theater in the conflict between Moscow and the West. Later on the patrol, Russian forces attempted to jam the plane’s GPS, and at one point, another Russian warship locked on to the plane with radar, a warning that it could open fire. Russian naval ships and a submarine were visible in the sea below. But the main reason the French naval plane was on patrol lay underwater. Three times over the past year and a half, commercial ships are suspected of having damaged critical undersea communications cables and a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. European officials fear that these were acts of sabotage, with the Kremlin viewed as the primary suspect, though finding hard evidence has proved difficult. A Russian naval ship seen on the monitor of an Atlantique 2 of the French Navy patrolling over the Baltic Sea this month. In response, NATO announced in January the start of a new program called Baltic Sentry, boosting sea and air patrols of the Baltic Sea. Though mostly reliant on NATO members with Baltic coastlines, like Sweden, Finland and Poland, the French and the British also participate, along with U.S. Marines deployed to Finland. At its inception, Baltic Sentry was hailed as an example of NATO’s renewal, and so far the mission has continued uninterrupted. This is despite President Trump’s frequent attacks on the 76-year-old military pact and his friendly overtures to the alliance’s most vociferous opponent, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Since the start of Baltic Sentry, announced days before Mr. Trump took office, no further cases of suspected sabotage have occurred in the Baltic Sea, though officials caution that the mission is still in its infancy. “It is indicative of the alliance’s ability to rapidly respond to such destabilization,” U.S. Army General Christopher G. Cavoli, the supreme allied commander Europe, said of Baltic Sentry in January, “and shows the strength of our unity in the face of any challenge.”Though officially Baltic Sentry is not directed against any particular country, Russia is clearly top of mind. This was evident throughout the patrol this month aboard the French naval aircraft. At the start of its patrol, the plane plunged low to observe the movements of the first Russian warship it encountered. There is little desire to provoke the Russians, said Romain, the lieutenant commander, though occasionally things escalate. As a precaution, each crew member is issued a parachute in case a midair evacuation is needed. A crew member at the back of an Atlantique 2 French Navy plane taking photographs of ships of interest over the Baltic Sea. “It’s a touchy situation,” Romain said, speaking on condition that only his first name and rank be used in accordance with French military rules. During the 14-hour mission, about a dozen crew members squeezed into a tight fuselage with an array of computer monitors showing satellite and radar data. The plane took off around 6 in the morning from a French airfield, traversed the length of the Baltic, from the northern coast of Germany to the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, then returned. But it was the Baltiysk naval base, headquarters of Russia’s Baltic Fleet, that was a focus of the crew’s attention. The plane had only been in range of the base, in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, for a few minutes when the instruments onboard began to show signs of GPS jamming. Below, a Russian attack submarine and several frigates cruised the waves. A crew member used the plane’s camera to zoom in on the vessels, while another flipped through a heavy reference manual of known naval craft trying to identify them. The camera also zoomed in on the base, where more craft were docked. A crew member flipped through a heavy reference manual of known naval craft. At one point, the targeting radar of one Russian ship briefly locked onto the French plane, which remained in international waters. Though this could be an indication the ship was preparing to fire, crew members said it was likely an attempt to gauge the plane’s altitude. In any case, the French military later expressed outrage. “This intimidation is part of unnecessarily aggressive actions hindering freedom of navigation,” said a message posted to the X account of the French military’s Joint Staff. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe has struggled with how to respond to a series of unusual occurrences, including suspected arson attacks and explosions, as well as assassination plots, that intelligence services increasingly assess to be part of a Kremlin campaign of sabotage. Though the Kremlin has denied its agents carry out sabotage,intelligence officials revealedlast fall that fires at two DHL shipping hubs in Britain and Germany were part of a Russian plot to put incendiary devices aboard cargo planes. It was the severing of undersea cables in the Baltic that ultimately prompted NATO to act. In late December, Finnish commandos descended from helicopters and seized control of an oil tanker called the Eagle S, which officials suspected had cut electrical and data cables linking Finland and Estonia. The robust military response followed similar episodes of civilian ships damaging undersea cables. A month earlier, a Chinese-owned bulk carrier called the Yi Peng 3 was forced to anchor in the Baltic, suspected of severing two undersea fiber optic cables. This resembled a case from a year earlier, when a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship appeared to damage a gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. In this photo released by the Finnish Border Guard, a Coast Guard ship patrolled near the Eagle S, top, which officials suspected had cut through an electrical cable linking Finland and Estonia. No hard evidence has emerged indicating the ships’ crews intentionally damaged the undersea infrastructure, let alone that the Kremlin directed them to do so. The ships were all flagged to different countries — though none to Russia — had different owners and were headed in different directions. In other cases, an initial suspicion of sabotage has not born out. In January, authorities seized a cargo ship suspected of damaging a communications cable linking Sweden and Latvia. Investigators later determined that bad weather combined with poor seamanship likely caused the damage. What links the other cases is a modus operandi: All seemed to have dropped their anchors midvoyage, dragging them along the sea floor in a way that damaged critical infrastructure. Shipping experts say it is highly unlikely crew members could fail to notice and immediately address this. That connection was enough to convince some leaders that something more nefarious than simple negligence had occurred. “We should keep in mind that Russia is not omnipotent; it can’t do everything,” Juha Martelius, Finland’s intelligence chief, said in televised remarks in January. “But it can do a lot, and therefore it’s important for us both nationally and in international cooperation to be vigilant about what happens in the Baltic Sea.”The Kremlin has dismissed accusations that Russia was behind a sabotage campaign in the Baltic Sea as “absurd.”Military and shipping experts largely praised the Baltic Sentry operation, though some said it did too little. The Baltic Sea is vulnerable given Russia’s access via several ports, but it is also, many point out, “a NATO lake,” ringed by eight members of the alliance, and therefore much easier to secure. More difficult is protecting critical infrastructure elsewhere, particularly the North Sea with its wind farms and oil infrastructure, as well as cables crossing the Atlantic Ocean from off Ireland’s coast. A pilot of an Atlantique 2 French Navy plane heading to patrol over the Baltic Sea. Baltic Sentry also does little to interfere with Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, a collection of aged tankers that, Western officials say, Moscow uses to covertly carry Russian crude around the world. The fleet is key to Russia’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, and Western nations have been largely unable to do anything about it. An exception was the ship that Finnish commandos commandeered in January. Officials have saidit bore the hallmarks of shadow fleet vessels. “Russia is using a shadow oil fleet to make its revenues and get around sanctions,” said Justin Crump, the chief executive of a private intelligence firm, Sibylline, and a maritime security expert. “We know they’re doing it, we know exactly how they’re doing it and yet we’re not allowed to stop it. If we were serious, we would stop it. That’s the missing ingredient.”Aboard the French Atlantique 2, Romain said, crews closely monitored ships suspected of operating as part of the shadow fleet, but acknowledged there was little the military could do but watch them. “There is no procedure to stop them in international waters,” he said. “There are no specific agreements to board them.”At points during the patrol, the plane’s captain received reports about ships behaving suspiciously. One had recently left the Russian port of Ust-Luga and another was headed to the Russian port of Primorsk. In each instance, the captain contacted the ships and questioned them about their journey. “Are you aware of the NATO activity Baltic Sentry?” the captain asked each of them, then inquired whether any had seen suspicious maritime activity.

Search and recovery operations for a fourth soldier who was also in the vehicle continued on Monday, the Army said. The 70-ton vehicle was pulled out of the bog early on Monday morning, the Army said. For days, hundreds of people, including technical experts and U.S. Navy divers, had worked to solve the complex engineering challenge of recovering the vehicle from the bog. The operation required excavators, pumps and other construction equipment. The soldierswere reported missing on Tuesdayafter they did not return from a training mission, according to the U.S. military. Their vehicle, an M88 Hercules, was found submerged in the bog on Wednesday. The missing soldiers, from the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, were training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus,a close ally of Russiaand a stalwart supporter of its war in Ukraine. Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, the Third Infantry Division’s commanding general,said in a statementon Monday that “the search isn’t finished until everyone is home.”“Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found,” General Norrie said. The soldiers had been sent out in the M88 Hercules, essentially a giant armored tow truck, to extract another Army vehicle, the military said. They may have driven off the road and into the bog, and the soldiers appeared to have been trapped inside, according to an Army official in Europe. U.S. Navy divers swam into the muddy bog, with zero visibility, to attach two cables to the sunken vehicle on Sunday night, the Army said. It took about two hours of winching to pull it out of the bog. U.S. soldiers attending Mass for the missing soldiers at a church in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, on Sunday. On Sunday, rescue efforts were hampered by a landslide, Dovile Sakaliene, the Lithuanian defense minister,saidon social media. She described the effort as an“exhausting fight with the power of the deep swamp.”The search for the fourth soldier will be challenging, according to a senior U.S. Army official in Europe. American and Lithuanian search crews were able to use sophisticated sonar technology to find the large, armored vehicle but such technology is less useful for locating a human body in a peat bog. The dive team has set up a grid system to methodically search for the fourth soldier, the official said. The initial search for the soldiers, through thick forests and swampy terrain, involved Lithuanian military helicopters and dive teams, and hundreds of American and Lithuanian soldiers and law enforcement officers, the U.S. Army said. Both Belarus and Russia have frequently criticized Lithuania, a member of NATO that used to be part of the Soviet Union, for hosting American and other allied troops. Lithuania and other former Soviet states in Eastern Europe are growing worried that President Trump will weaken NATO. Their participation in recovery efforts to find the missing U.S. soldiers showcased what President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuaniasaid was the value of allies acting together. Poland, Lithuania’s neighbor and another member of NATO, also sent military engineers to help. Eric Schmittcontributed reporting. Kitty Bennettcontributed research. Missing Soldiers"

Even as he prosecutes the war in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu faces escalating judicial and political battles at home. Reporting from JerusalemNetanyahu, Standing Trial for Corruption, Summoned for Questioning in 2nd CaseThe war in Gaza has often distracted from an internal battle between Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and other parts of the state. On Monday, that domestic conflict careened into full view. As Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has led his country through 18 months of war in Gaza, he has also been locked in a less visible conflict at home — against parts of the Israeli state. On Monday, a sequence of court hearings, detentions, interrogations and government announcements highlighted how destabilizing that domestic fight has become. A look at the Israeli leader’s day tells the story. Mr. Netanyahu spent his morning in court in Tel Aviv for the latest session of his yearslong corruption trial. The prime minister is accused of granting regulatory favors to businessmen in exchange for bribes and positive news coverage — charges he denies. By the afternoon, he had left court early to be questioned in Jerusalem by police officers investigating a new and separate case involving the prime minister’s aides, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely. During the course of the day, two of those aides were detained, the officials said. And against that backdrop, Mr. Netanyahu pressed ahead with efforts to replace a senior intelligence chief, Ronen Bar, who helped instigate the investigation against the prime minister’s aides. On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu’s office announced that Eli Sharvit, a former Navy commander, had been nominated to replace Mr. Bar, the current head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic spy agency. The move stopped short of immediately ousting Mr. Bar, but it tested the limits of a Supreme Court order that suspended Mr. Bar’s dismissal until April 8. Eli Sharvit in 2021. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s appointment of the former navy leader as head of the domestic spy agency was criticized for a lack of due process. Even by the chaotic standards of contemporary Israel, the accelerating sequence of clashes between Mr. Netanyahu and other state institutions was breathtaking in its intensity. In less than a day, Mr. Netanyahu came under pressure from the police; accelerated a battle with the Shin Bet; went head-to-head against state prosecutors, and edged closer to a constitutional showdown with the Supreme Court. All the while, Mr. Netanyahu continued to oversee Israel’s longest-ever war. On Monday the Israeli military continued to step up its operations in Gaza, ordering Palestinian civilians to leave Rafah, a major city on the border with Egypt, suggesting a bombardment was imminent. Israeli troops also continue to occupy territory in Lebanon and Syria, and remain on alert for attacks from Hamas’s allies in Yemen. “It’s crazy and hard to believe what’s going on,” said Ami Ayalon, a former director of the Shin Bet. Mr. Ayalon compared the combination of internal and external conflicts to the years preceding the fall of Jerusalem in the first century, when Jewish factions battled each other as the Roman Army prepared to sack the city. “That is the only comparison, when you had Jews killing each other inside Jerusalem, and the Romans outside, surrounding the city,” Mr. Ayalon said. Mr. Netanyahu has been at loggerheads with the judiciary and sections of law enforcement since 2016, when he was first investigated for corruption. His prosecution began in 2020, and his refusal to resign while standing trial left the Israeli electorate divided roughly evenly between his supporters and critics. That split caused profound electoral instability and led to five elections in less than four years. Now, Mr. Netanyahu is contending with a separate investigation — instigated last fall by the Shin Bet — into advisers and communications experts in his office. Mr. Netanyahu is not a suspect in that second case, but his aides are accused of leaking classified information to a foreign newspaper and receiving payments from people connected to the Qatari government. Mr. Netanyahu’s critics have accused him of firing Mr. Bar for failing to end that investigation. . Mr. Netanyahu has denied the charge, saying that Mr. Bar was dismissed because of a breakdown of trust between the two men. Mr. Netanyahu has also blamed Mr. Bar for lapses early on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, that allowed Hamas to launch its attack on Israel that day and ignite the war in Gaza. A Qatari government official said the claims were a “smear campaign” aimed at derailing Qatar’s efforts to mediate an end to the war in Gaza. Protesters criticizing Prime Minister Netanyahu and demanding he secure the release of hostages from Gaza, in Jerusalem on Monday. The standoff over Mr. Bar is at the heart ofa broader dispute among Israelisabout how the country should be governed. It isthe latest in a series of movesby the prime minister to expand his executive power and diminish the influence and independence of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies. Last week, Israel’s governing coalition passed a law in Parliament that gives politiciansmore control over the selection of Supreme Court justices. And earlier in March, the cabinet began the process offiring the government’s top lawyer, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has angered Mr. Netanyahu by questioning the legality of government decisions — including the dismissal of Mr. Bar. To Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters, the moves are an attempt to enhance Israel’s democracy by giving elected lawmakers greater control over the country’s direction. To his opponents, they are an attempt to shield politicians from scrutiny and accountability, edging Israel toward autocracy, and to stop Mr. Netanyahu’s trial. In particular, critics view the move against Ms. Baharav-Miara, who oversees the ongoingprosecution of Mr. Netanyahu for corruption, as an attempt to undermine the trial. Mr. Netanyahu denies both the corruption charges and the claim that he is trying to undermine the proceedings. On Monday, he also presented Mr. Sharvit’s nomination as simply the promotion of a worthy professional. “Vice Admiral Sharvit served in the I.D.F. for 36 years, including five years as commander of the Israel Navy,” Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement said, using an abbreviation for Israel Defense Forces. He added that Mr. Sharvit helped build the “maritime defense of the territorial waters and conducted complex operations against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.”Mr. Netanyahu’s allies even wondered if Mr. Sharvit might prove too independent, following reports that he had protested in 2023 against the government’s efforts to reduce judicial power. But opposition leaders, while acknowledging Mr. Sharvit’s leadership qualities, complained that he had been appointed without due process. Now, Israelis are waiting to see how the Supreme Court will assess Mr. Bar’s dismissal at the planned hearing on April 8 — and how Mr. Netanyahu will respond. “No one knows where it’s going,” Mr. Ayalon said.

Damien Cave covers global affairs and is The Times’s Vietnam bureau chief. How Trump Supercharged Distrust, Driving U.S. Allies AwayNews AnalysisTrust is very hard to build and easy to destroy. America and its partners are caught in a spiral of distrust. The F-35, a fifth-generation fighter, was developed in partnership with eight countries, making ita model of international cooperation. When President Trump introduced a sixth-generation aircraft, the F-47, he praised its strengths — and said the version sold to allies would be deliberately downgraded. That made sense, Mr. Trump said last week, “because someday, maybe they’re not our allies.”For many countries wedded to the United States, his remark confirmed a related conclusion: that America can no longer be trusted. Even nations not yet directly affected can see where things are heading, as Mr. Trump threatens allies’ economies, their defense partnerships and even their sovereignty. For now, they are negotiating to minimize the pain from blow after blow, including a broad round of tariffs expected in April. But at the same time, they are pulling back. Preparing for intimidation to be a lasting feature of U.S. relations, they are trying to go their own way. A few examples: Canada made a$4.2 billion deal with Australiathis month to develop cutting-edge radar and announced that it was in talks totake part inthe European Union’s military buildup. Portugal and other NATO nations arereconsidering plansto buy F-35s, fearing American control over parts and software. Negotiations over a free trade and technology deal between the European Union and India have suddenlyacceleratedafter years of delays. Brazil is not only increasing trade with China, it’s doing it inChina’s currency, sidelining the dollar. In several countries, including Poland, South Korea and Australia, discussions about whether tobuild or secure access to nuclear weaponsare now commonplace. Some degree of distancing from the United States had already been in motion as other countries became wealthier, more capable and less convinced that American centrality would be permanent. But the past few months of Trump 2.0 have supercharged the process. The U.S.S. Alexandria, a nuclear-powered submarine, docking at a South Korean naval base in February. History and psychology help explain why. Few forces have such a powerful, long-lasting impact on geopolitics as distrust, according to social scientists who study international relations. It has repeatedly poisoned negotiations in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It kept Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union burning for decades. So-called realists — who see international relations as an amoral contest between self-interested states — argue that trust should always be assessed with skepticism, because believing in good intentions is risky. But Mr. Trump has sparked more than cautious suspicion. His own distrust of allies, evident in hiszero-sum beliefthat gains for others are losses for America, has been reciprocated. What it’s created is familiar — a distrust spiral. If you think the other person (or country) is not trustworthy, you’re more likely to break rules and contracts without shame,studies show, reinforcing a partner’s own distrust, leading to more aggression or reduced interaction. “Trust is fragile,” Paul Slovic, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, wrote in a seminal1993 studyon risk, trust and democracy. “It is typically created rather slowly, but it can be destroyed in an instant — by a single mishap or mistake.”In Mr. Trump’s case, allies point to a sustained assault. His tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which ignored the North American free trade deal that he signed during his first term, stunned America’s neighbors. Mr. Trump’s distrust for allies, evident in his belief that gains for others are losses for America, is being reciprocated. His threats to make Canada an American state and send the U.S. military into Mexico to go after drug cartels were brash intrusions on sovereignty, not unlike his demands for Greenland and the Panama Canal. His blaming of Ukraine for the war that Russia started further alienated allies, forcing them to ask: Is the United States a defender of dictators or democracy? Relatively quickly, they have determined that even if Mr. Trump’s boldest proposals — like turning Gaza into a Mideast Riviera — are fantasies, the trend lines point in the same direction: toward a world order less like the Olympics and more like Ultimate Fighting. Perhaps no country is more shocked than Canada. It shares the world’s largest undefended border with the United States, despite their wide disparity in military strength. Why? Because Canadians trusted America. Now, in large part, they do not. Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, said on Thursday that his country’s traditional relationship with the United States was “over.”“Trump has violated the deep assumption in Canadian foreign policy that the U.S. is an inherently trustworthy nation,” said Brian Rathbun, a global affairs professor at the University of Toronto. “That is very threatening to basic Canadian interests in trade and security, leading it to cast around for alternatives.”Economic patriotism is somewhat new for Canada, but it has given rise to aBuy Canadianmovement that urges consumers to shun American products and stocks. Canadians are also canceling U.S. holidays in large numbers. A Vancouver liquor store manager removing American whiskey from his shelves. More significant in the longer term, Mr. Trump’s threats have forged a surprising consensus around a policy that had been contentious or ignored: that Canada should be building pipelines, ports and other infrastructure east to west, not north to south, to reduce its reliance on the United States and push its resources outward to Asia and Europe. Europe is further ahead in this process. After the U.S. election, the European Unionfinalized a trade dealwith South American countries to create one of the world’s largest trade zones, and it has worked toward closer trade ties withIndia,South AfricaSouth KoreaandMexico. Japan, America’s largest ally in Asia, has also been prioritizing new markets in the global south, where fast-growing economies like Vietnam’s offer new customers. “There has been the emerging perception in Japan that we definitely have to change the portfolio of our investments,” said Ken Jimbo, a professor of international politics and security at Keio University in Tokyo. For the current administration and those that follow, he added, “we have to adjust our expectations of the American alliance.”On the defense front, what some call “de-Americanization” is more challenging. This is especially true in Asia, where there is no NATO equivalent, and reliance on American support has somewhat stunted the militaries of countries that the United States has promised to defend (Japan, South Korea and the Philippines). Military exercises in the Philippines this month. The country has expanded its defense ties with Japan and New Zealand. On Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethwas in Manila, promising to “truly prioritize and shift to this region.” But many of America’s partners are now working together without the United States, signing reciprocal access agreements for each other’s troops and building new coalitions to deter China as much as they can. Europe, too, isyears awayfrom being able to fully defend itself without the help of U.S. weaponry and technology. Yet in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs, threats and general disdain — as in the leaked Signal chat in which Mr. Hegseth called Europe “pathetic” — the European Union recently announced plans to ramp up military spending. That includesa 150 billion euro loanprogram to finance defense investment. The 27-nation European Union is also increasingly collaborating with two nonmembers, Britain and Norway, on defending Ukraine and on other strategic defense priorities. For some countries, none of this is quite enough. Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk,told Parliamentin early March that Poland would explore gaining access to nuclear weapons, fearing that Mr. Trump could not be trusted to defend a fellow NATO nation fully. “This is a race for security,” Mr. TusksaidPrime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland would explore the possibility of gaining access to nuclear arms. In February, South Korea’s foreign minister, Cho Tae-yul, told the National Assembly that building nuclear weapons was “not on the table, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is off the table either.” By some estimates, both South Korea and Japan have the technical know-how to develop nuclear weapons in less than two months. Bilihari Kausikan, a former Singaporean diplomat, said that a little mistrust can lead to healthy caution, noting that Asia has been skeptical of America since the Vietnam War. He said the end result of the Trump era could be “a more diversified world, with more maneuvering space” and a less dominant United States. But for now, distrust is spreading. Experts said it would take years and a slew of costly trust-building efforts to bring America together with allies, new or old, for anything long-term. “Trust is difficult to create and easy to lose,” said Deborah Welch Larson, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles who wrote a book about mistrust’s Cold War role. She added, “Mistrust of the United States’ intentions and motives is growing day by day.”Reporting was contributed byMatina Stevis-Gridnefffrom Toronto,Jeanna Smialekfrom Brussels,Choe Sang-Hunfrom Seoul andMartin Facklerfrom Tokyo.

Zimbabwe’s Leader Faces Call for Removal From Within His Own PartyNearly eight years after the coup that brought him to power, President Emmerson Mnangagwa is under threat from opponents within his governing ZANU-PF party, who have urged mass protests. Battling a yearslong economic crisis and persistent accusations of corruption, Zimbabwe’s president faces the greatest threat to his power since taking office in a coup nearly eight years ago, with members of his own party calling for his resignation. The president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has vowed to crack down on dissent,saying in a speechat a meeting of his party, ZANU-PF, that calls for him to step down were a “treasonous” plot driven by “chameleon-like characters.”The tensions over the president’s future have pushed this southern African nation, which has suffered decades of political and economic instability, to the brink of yet another crisis, with many anxious residents bracing for potential violence. Planned nationwide demonstrations on Monday were mostly quiet as many chose to stay home rather than face a government crackdown. Over the past two decades, persistent hyperinflation in Zimbabwe has left the country struggling to keep a currency worth the paper it’s printed on. The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce estimates that 80 percent of jobs in the country are in the informal sector, with low pay and little security. Buying produce with a U.S. dollar in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital. The country has struggled to re-establish a stable currency of its own. Accusations of gross rights abuses, political repression, dubious elections and corruption have tarnished Zimbabwe’s international standing. The United States has imposed sanctions on members of the country’s ruling elite, including Mr. Mnangagwa. Mr. Mnangagwa, 82, promised democratic and economic reforms when he helped to overthrow Robert Mugabe, an autocrat in power for 37 years, in 2017. Instead, he has failed to harness the country’s wealth of critical minerals into an economic boom. He also fired Zimbabwe’s army chief, Anselem Sanyatwe,ahead of the planned nationwideprotests on Monday. The shake-up follows the removal of the chief of police and head of Zimbabwe’s intelligence service — moves that political analysts widely view as an effort to protect Mr. Mnangagwa against a military takeover. Zimbabweans — who have fled the country by the hundreds of thousands over the past two decades — continue to leave in droves, fomenting animosity among neighboring countries feeling the strain of growing migrant populations. “Zimbabwe is saying Mugabe was better — that is how bad the situation is,” said Ntokozo Msipha, a ZANU-PF member who has helped organize the protests against Mr. Mnangagwa. “We should have done this earlier.”Those leading the charge against Mr. Mnangagwa accuse him of trying to extend his rule beyond the end of his second term in 2028. His opponents say he previously promised to hand over power to his vice president, Constantino Chiwenga. Earlier this year, the governing party said it would amend the Constitution so Mr. Mnangagwa could run for a third term in 2028. Mr. Chiwenga, a decorated army general,was an architect of the coupthat toppled Mr. Mugabe. He is now the man whom Mr. Mnangagwa’s opponents want to replace him. He has not publicly commented on the upheaval caused by ZANU-PF allies. Some critics of Mr. Mnangagwa have suggested that his vice president, Constantino Chiwenga, should replace him. The effort to oust Mr. Mnangagwa has been led by Blessed Geza, a liberation war veteran and former senior ZANU-PF member. Mr. Geza went into hiding this month after party officials accused him of treason. In a news conference last week, Mr. Geza called on the president “to go or face being removed.”Tafadzwa Mugwadi, a ZANU-PF member of Parliament, dismissed Mr. Geza and his faction of disgruntled war veterans within the party as having no credibility. “I have no record of any internal factional fights,” Mr. Mugwadi said. “I don’t understand his authority.”Even as his supporters brush off critics, Mr. Mnangagwa seemed to be leaving nothing to chance. The police presence was heavy across the capital, Harare, on Friday last week. Officers clutching batons roamed Africa Unity Square Park, a well-known protest site, as people ate food on the lawn and lounged on benches. At a roadblock in Mabvuku, just outside Harare, the police searched vehicles, telling motorists that they were looking for weapons and acting on the government’s instructions to prevent violent protesters. After getting his car searched, Gilbert Tapfumaneyi said he would return to town on Monday without his vehicle to join the protests. Mr. Tapfumaneyi, a car salesman, said he did not make enough money to buy gas. “We have suffered enough,” he said. Many workers in central Harare stayed home on Monday out of fear of violence breaking out at the protests. Others said they had little choice but to go to work. “I have mouths to feed back home,” said Belinda Chisewu, a roadside vendor selling cellphone credit, adding that she had three children. The ZANU-PF infighting may have less to do with the challenges faced by ordinary citizens and more to do with a battle over state power and resources, political analysts said. Rashweat Mukundu, a Zimbabwe-based media researcher and rights activist, said the divisions within the party were comparable to what happened in the Mugabe era. “What we are seeing is a similar pattern of the ruling party failing to manage its transition,” he said. “An incumbent perhaps wanting to be an imperial president and stay in power until death, and that always agitates those who have political aspirations.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

"As Tensions Escalate Between Trump and Europe, Meloni Is Caught in the Middle",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/europe/italy-meloni-trump-europe-tensions.html,2025-03-31T04:01:07Z,World,"Each new crisis, whether over Ukraine or tariffs, has made the Italian prime minister’s balancing act that much harder.",United States Politics and Government; Politics and Government; International Relations; International Trade and World Market; Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022),"Meloni, Giorgia (1977- ); Musk, Elon; Trump, Donald J; Vance, J D; Zelensky, Volodymyr",Europe; Italy,North Atlantic Treaty Organization,"Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy speaking at the Senate in Rome this month. Reporting from RomeAs Tensions Escalate Between Trump and Europe, Meloni Is Caught in the MiddleEach new crisis, whether over Ukraine or tariffs, has made the Italian prime minister’s balancing act that much harder. Amid raucous questioning by opposition members in Italy’s Parliament this month, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni noted that she had been asked repeatedly: “Are you with Europe or with the United States?”The prime minister responded that she was always with Italy and by extension, Europe. “I don’t blindly follow Europe or the United States,” she said, adding, “But I’m also for the unity of the West, and I think that is necessary for both Europe and Italy.”Just a couple of months ago, when President Trump was inaugurated, Ms. Meloni seemed perfectly positioned to be a bridge between him and Europe. She was the only European leader at his inauguration, matched his hostility toward liberal ideals, befriended Elon Musk and seemed eager to land the role. Instead, as tensions between Europe and Washington escalate, she finds herself caught in the middle, balancing her ideological affinity with Mr. Trump with the need for Italy to help bolster the continent’s security and economy. It is not clear that Mr. Trump, who is openly antagonistic toward Europe, wants a bridge. In addition, the leaders ofBritainandFrance, both outweighing Italy as nuclear powers, have sought the role of liaison between Europe and the White House for themselves. As Europeratchets upmilitary spending and girds for a potential trade war, Ms. Meloni continues to preach pragmatism while trying to avoid choosing sides. The balancing act could become harder to sustain. Each new crisis with Mr. Trump — over a possible peace deal with Russia, over NATO, over tariffs — further underscores Ms. Meloni’s eroding middle position, analysts said. “She is cleverly not taking sides until she is obliged to do it and hoping that she is never obliged to do it,” said Giovanni Orsina, the head of the political science department at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. Ms. Meloni arriving in London in March for a summit with European leaders on the war in Ukraine. But he added, “If the Atlantic alliance gets into greater stress and there is a distancing between the U.S. and Europe, this position will be more difficult to hold.”Once a fringe firebrand with political roots in a party born from the ashes of fascism, Ms. Meloni has cast herself as a credible leader in Europe, largely thanks to her unwavering support for Ukraine and NATO. Domestically, she has thrown occasional bones to her hard-line base, including by introducing a “universal” ban on surrogacy, while simultaneously steering a conservative fiscal policy that allayed the worst fears of European leaders. Some called that pragmatism, while others accused her of “doppiezza,” Italian for “duplicity.”On the international stage, Ms. Meloni has become a bundle of contradictions: an Italian nationalist seemingly in tune with Mr. Trump’s hard-right international movement leading a country whose lot is inextricably tied to the fate of Europe. In the past couple of months, her main tool in not alienating either Washington or Europe was a studied silence, or when that proved impossible, anodyne calls for the West to maintain its strength through its traditional unity. Now, she increasingly tries to have it both ways. Ms. Meloni’s comments to the Italian Senate before a late March summit of European leaders in Brussels were some of her most extensive about the multiple controversies stirred up by Mr. Trump and his administration. A staunch supporter of Ukraine, Ms. Meloni endorsed Mr. Trump’s effort to negotiate a cease-fire, calling it “a first significant step in a path that must lead to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.”But while she has upheld her commitment to providing security guarantees to Ukraine, she has been less vocally supportive of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Ms. Meloni at a Group of 7 Summit in Savelletri, Italy, last summer. After he was berated by Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office in early March, she did not, like other European leaders, rebuke the president and express her support for Mr. Zelensky. Instead, Ms. Meloni responded to the fiery exchange by calling for a U.S.-Europe summit. No such meeting occurred. She has criticized the response of some European leaders to the Trump administration as “a bit too political” and suggested that it is “childish” to expect Italy to have to chose between Europe and the United States. While Italy would gladly help Europe avoid a confrontation, she said inan interviewwith The Financial Times published on Friday: “I’m not interested in saying, ‘I’m the one in the middle, I’m a protagonist.’ Not now. The stakes are too high.”Unlike France and Britain, which have led the effort to organize a European force for Ukraine, Italy rejected the idea of deploying its troops. As Mr. Trump threatens to withdraw the U.S. commitment to Europe, Italy has largely backed the idea that Europe must invest in rearming. Although Ms. Meloni has described the United States as Italy’s closest ally, Rome’s relatively low military spending might create friction with Mr. Trump. It falls below the 2 percent of gross domestic product required by NATO guidelines, not to mention the 5 percent pushed by Washington. One of her coalition partners adamantly opposes any increase. On tariffs, Ms. Meloni has called for moderation and negotiation. She warned that retaliatory tariffs could set off a “vicious circle” in which everyone loses, driving up inflation and restricting economic growth. “I am convinced that we need to work concretely and with pragmatism to find common ground and avoid a trade war that would not benefit anyone,” Ms. Meloni said in Parliament. For now, Ms. Meloni’s relations with Mr. Trump and his team seem good, even if no White House visit has been announced. Mr. Trump praised Ms. Meloni in late February, calling her “a wonderful woman” and noting that “Italy has got very strong leadership.” Ms. Melonireposted Mr. Trump’s comments on X. In turn, she has lauded both Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance, as she did in a live address by video at the annual CPAC conference near Washington, where she has been a regular speaker for years. She underscored their shared political agenda and characterized Mr. Trump’s re-election as a major development in the rise of global conservatism. How long her balancing act can last is the question dogging her. Ms. Meloni speaking via video at the CPAC conference in Oxon Hill, Md., in February. In the seaside town of Viareggio, Italy, the spectacular annual carnival parade is famous for political satire. This year one float featured a 50-foot statue of the prime minister. The float’s creator, Alessandro Avanzini, had dressed the figure of Ms. Meloni in a pink suit jacket, swaying inside a pair of oversize gray jodhpurs of the kind once favored by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Mr. Avanzini said that he had left it deliberately unclear whether Ms. Meloni was donning the jodhpurs or shedding them. Various spectators said that accurately reflected the current political discussion in Italy surrounding the ambiguity at which the prime minister excels. “She is very clever at understanding when she has to wear them,” said Stefania Giusti, 48, an agricultural project manager. “When she is meeting Trump, she puts them on, but when she goes to Brussels, she takes them off,” Ms. Giusti said. “But I do not think that she can go on like this for long.”Elizabeth DjinisVirginia DiGaetanocontributed reporting.

London Police Arrest Gaza Protest Planners at Quaker HouseQuakers in Britain said the raid, in which six youth activists unaffiliated with the religious group were arrested, “clearly shows what happens when a society criminalizes protest.”Quakers in Britain are reeling from what they say is an unheard-of violation of one of their places of worship by police officers who forced their way into a meeting house in London and arrested activists gathered there to plan Gaza war protests. “No one has been arrested in a Quaker meeting house in living memory,” Paul Parker, the recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said ina statementissued after the raid. But on Thursday evening, the pacifist group said, more than 20 uniformed police officers, some armed with tasers, forced their way into the meeting house in Westminster, breaking open the front door “without warning or ringing the bell.”The officers searched the building and arrested six women at a gathering of Youth Demand, an unaffiliated activist group that was renting a room to meet in, the Quakers in Britain said. The Metropolitan Police said the arrests followed Youth Demand’s plans to “shut down” London with protests next month, according toBritish media. The police said that while they recognized the right to protest, “we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality,”reported. The arrests raised alarms in England, and came amid acrackdown on Gaza War protestersin the United States, especially on college campuses, where some students have denounced Israel’s prosecution of the war against Hamas. Legal experts say that the Trump administration has been trampling on free speech rights, and after the raid on the meeting house, Quakers in Britain voiced similar concerns. “This aggressive violation of our place of worship and the forceful removal of young people holding a protest group meeting clearly shows what happens when a society criminalizes protest,” Mr. Parker said. In recent years, Britain has enacted several measures to crack down on protests and granted new powers to the police. One of the measures, Public Order Act 2023, wasdescribedby the United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, as “deeply troubling.” The law imposes “serious and undue restrictions” on the right of peaceful assembly and criminalizes some forms of peaceful protest by Britons,according to the United Nations. Youth Demand said inthat when the raid took place, it was having a “Welcome Talk” at the Quaker house to discuss Gaza, the West Bank and the climate crisis, and to share plans for nonviolent civil resistance actions that it has scheduled for next month. The activists were told that they were being detained on suspicions of “conspiracy to cause a public nuisance,” according to the group. Additional activists from the group were arrested the next day, it said. Youth Demand said in an email on Sunday that it did not “have the full picture yet,” but that it appeared that about 10 arrests were made on Thursday and Friday and that 11 activists’ homes were raided. All of the activists have been released and none have been charged, the group said. Youth Demand, which calls on the British government to stop all trade with Israel and to raise money from the wealthy to pay for environmental damage from fossil-fuel burning, was started last year. While relatively small, some of its protests have generatedheadlinesIn April, the group hung a banner and lined up children’s shoes outside the home of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, before he became prime minister. “Stop the killing” in Gaza, the banner read. In a statement after the raid, the group  called on “young people to take to the streets day after day and shut London down.”Ella Grace-Taylor, 20, an actor-musician student who was arrested on Thursday at the meeting house, said ina videoafter her release that the group “will not be deterred.”“We will let this fuel us because we know this means that we are winning,” she said. “It means that the government, that the police, that the state is afraid of us, that they recognize the power that we have.”The Metropolitan Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump’s U.S.A.I.D. Cuts Hobble Earthquake Response in Myanmar,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-usaid-cuts.html,2025-03-30T20:04:12Z,World,"While China, Russia and other nations have rushed emergency response teams to the devastated country, the U.S., once a leader in foreign aid, has been slow to act.","Myanmar Earthquake (March 28, 2025); Earthquakes; Humanitarian Aid; United States International Relations; Foreign Aid; International Relations","Trump, Donald J",Myanmar,United States Agency for International Development,"Rescue workers carrying a victim trapped under a destroyed condominium building in Mandalay, Myanmar, on Sunday. Trump’s U.S.A.I.D. Cuts Hobble Earthquake Response in MyanmarWhile China, Russia and other nations have rushed emergency response teams to the devastated country, the U.S., once a leader in foreign aid, has been slow to act. China, Russia and India have dispatched emergency teams and supplies to earthquake-ravaged Myanmar. So have Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. The United States, the richest country in the world and once its most generous provider of foreign aid, has sent nothing. Even as President Trump wasdismantlingthe U.S. Agency for International Development, he said that American help was on its way to Myanmar, where a7.7-magnitude earthquakeripped through the country’s heavily populated center on Friday. More than 1,700 people were killed, according to Myanmar’s military government, with the death toll expected to climb steeply as more bodies are uncovered in the rubble and rescue teams reach remote villages. But a three-person U.S.A.I.D. assessment team is not expected to arrive until Wednesday, people with knowledge of the deployment efforts said. The overall American response has been slower than under normal circumstances, people who have worked on earlier disaster relief efforts as well as on aid to Myanmar said. Chinese search-and-rescue teams, complete with dogs trained to sniff out trapped people, are already on the ground in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city and one of the places most deeply affected by the quake. China haspledged $14 millionfor Myanmar quake relief, sending 126 rescue workers and six dogs, along with medical kits, drones and earthquake detectors. “Being charitable and being seen as charitable serves American foreign policy,” said Michael Schiffer, the assistant administrator of the U.S.A.I.D. bureau for Asia from 2022 until earlier this year. “If we don’t show up and China shows up, that sends a pretty strong message.”Chinese rescue team members, in blue, searching Sunday for people in the rubble of a damaged temple in Mandalay. On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar announced on its website that the United States would provide up to $2 million in aid, dispersed through humanitarian groups based in Myanmar. But many of the systems needed to funnel American aid to Myanmar have been shattered. On Friday, as some employees in Washington in U.S.A.I.D.’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance were preparing a response to the earthquake, they receivedagencywide layoff emails. Career diplomats working for U.S.A.I.D. and other employees had been bracing for layoffs for weeks; Trump political appointees in Washington had already fired most of the contractors working for the agency. The employees who received layoff notices were told they should go home that afternoon. Some had been coordinating with aid missions in Bangkok and Manila, which handle disaster response in Asia. Two of the employees in Washington had expected to move this winter to Yangon, in Myanmar, and to Bangkok to work as humanitarian assistance advisers out of the U.S. missions there. But those positions were cut. Had they not been, the two employees would have been on the ground to organize urgent responses to the earthquake. After the disaster hit on Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Yangon sent a cable to U.S.A.I.D. headquarters in Washington to start the process of evaluating aid needs and getting help out the door. And the next day, a Trump administration political appointee in U.S.A.I.D.,Tim Meisburger, held a call with officials from national security agencies to discuss a plan. But Mr. Meisburger said that although there would be a response, no one should expect the agency’s capabilities to be what they were in the past, said a person with direct knowledge of the call. A U.S.A.I.D. spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment. Police officers blocking off the road in front of the American Center and the U.S. Embassy in Yangon, Myanmar, in 2021. The agency typically has access to food and emergency supplies in warehouses in Dubai and Subang Jaya, Malaysia. But the big question now is how quickly, after being almost fully dismantled, it can get goods from those places into Myanmar. The goods include medical kits that can each serve the health care needs of 30,000 people for over three months. Apart from career diplomats, the ranks of the agency’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance have included crisis specialist contractors who live around the globe and can deploy quickly in what are called Disaster Assistance Response Teams. Many of those contractors have been fired, and the infrastructure to support them in Washington and other offices — people who can book flights and manage payments, for instance — was crippled by cuts over the last two months. The agency would also usually put certified search-and-rescue teams in Virginia and Southern California on alert for possible deployment to the disaster zone, but transportation contracts for those teams have been cut, said one former aid agency employee. U.S.A.I.D.’s annual allocations for Myanmar were about $320 million last year. About $170 million of that was for humanitarian work, and the rest was for development initiatives, like democracy building and health. Only a few million dollars’ worth of projects remain operational, though some of those programs, like one for maternal and child health, have not received funding despite being told the initiatives are not being closed down. Before the cuts, the annual costs of total U.S. foreign aid were less than 1 percent of the federal budget. The collapsed condominium project in Mandalay on Sunday. At a news conference in Jamaica last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States would continue foreign aid work, though in drastically reduced form. He said the aim was to provide aid “that is strategically aligned with our foreign policy priorities and the priorities of our host countries and our nation states that we’re partners with.”On Friday, Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokeswoman, said that crisis teams stood ready to deploy to Myanmar. The United States’ ability to provide lifesaving aid has been hampered not just by budget cuts but by obstacles in Myanmar itself. Since grabbing power in 2021, Myanmar’s military junta has closed off the country from Western influences. Myanmar is now embroiled in civil war, with a loose coalition of opposition forces having wrested control of more than half of the country’s territory. The United States and other Western nations have responded to the junta’s brutal human rights record with sanctions, and the military chief who orchestrated the coup, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has railed against the West, thanking China and Russia for ideological and economic support. In this image released by the Russian Emergency Ministry Press Service on Sunday, Russian planes can be seen at an airport in Myanmar. Nevertheless, in the hours after the earthquake struck, General Min Aung Hlaing said he welcomed outside disaster relief aid — and not just from countries with friendly relations with the military regime. Myanmar experts say they are concerned that some of the aid that goes through the junta could be diverted to the armed forces. The Myanmar military is underfunded and short on morale as it fights resistance forces on many fronts. In Mandalay, residents said they were upset to see soldiers lounging around the sites of collapsed buildings. Some played video games on their phones, while locals used their hands to pry bricks from the rubble. Still, Chinese and Russian search-and-rescue teams, outfitted in orange and blue uniforms, were digging through the wreckage in Mandalay on Sunday, and a Belgian squad was making its way north. A good chunk of U.S.A.I.D. funding had been dedicated to areas of the country not under junta control. American assistance has gone to health care and schooling for internally displaced people. It has supported local administrations that are trying to form mini-governments in conflict areas. And it has tried to provide emergency relief to civilians battered by junta airstrikes. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing arriving Friday to meet earthquake survivors gathered in the compound of a hospital in Naypyidaw, the capital. In the region of Sagaing, a stronghold of resistance against the junta, Myanmar military jets carried out two rounds of airstrikes on Nwel Khwe village hours after the earthquake destroyed buildings there, adding more terror to residents’ lives. “It’s as if Min Aung Hlaing wants to make sure we die, if not from the earthquake, then from his attacks,” said one villager, Ko Aung Kyaw. But Mr. Aung Kyaw said he did not expect foreigners, American or otherwise, to be able to alleviate the situation. Sagaing has suffered for four years, and its people have died by the thousands in fighting the junta. Foreign aid, he said, would most likely end up benefiting the military regime, not those who most need it. “In the end, we have only ourselves,” he said. “We’ve been resisting for four years now, and it’s clear that we’ll have to find our own way forward, no matter what.”Stephanie Nolencontributed reporting,Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

He was born in Sri Lanka but spent most of his career teaching in the United States. Gananath Obeyesekere, 95, Dies; Anthropologist Bridged East and WestHis wide-ranging work drew on field research in his native Sri Lanka as well as his extensive study of English literature and Christian mysticism. Gananath Obeyesekere, an anthropologist whose long career and wide-ranging social insights — which drew on Hindu texts, Freudian psychoanalysis and Christian mysticism — made him a leading intellectual figure in both his native Sri Lanka and the rarefied world of Western academia, died on Tuesday at his home in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He was 95. His son Asita confirmed the death. Dr. Obeyesekere was born in a Sri Lankan village at a time when the country, then known as Ceylon, was still in the grip of the British Empire. He spent most of his career teaching in the United States, primarily at Princeton University, where he established his reputation as a critical voice in debates about colonialism, pluralism and the possibility of finding commonalities across cultural divides. Long prominent among academics, he broke into the broader public’s consciousness in 1992 with his book “The Apotheosis of Captain Cook: European Mythmaking in the Pacific.”Dr. Obeyesekere gained a broad audience in 1992 with a book challenging the common understanding of why Capt. James Cook was killed by Hawaiian islanders. Cap. James Cook was a British explorer who, after being received with great ceremony by Hawaiian islanders in 1779, unexpectedly returned and was murdered by the same people who had warmly welcomed him before. Among historians and anthropologists, the common understanding was that the islanders had believed Captain Cook to be a god, and that his return, because of a broken mast on his ship, inadvertently fulfilled a belief in a banished god who would one day be defeated by their chief. Dr. Obeyesekere saw it differently. The Hawaiians, he believed, knew he was just a man; had honored him as an honorary chief, not a god; and had killed him over a more secular dispute. Westerners, in saying otherwise, had then imposed their own biases on the Hawaiians, in a sense creating their own myths about a mythmaking people. “This ‘European god,’” he wrote, “is a myth of conquest, imperialism and civilization.”Among his targets wasMarshall Sahlins, another prominent anthropologist, who had argued the god-making thesis in 1985 in his book “Islands of History.”Dr. Sahlins responded to Dr. Obeyesekere with a second book. In “How ‘Natives’ Think: About Captain Cook, for Example” (1995), he said that Dr. Obeyesekere was the real imperialist, because he denied the possibility that Hawaiians could have a way of seeing reality that was fundamentally different from the West’s. The debate was covered widely, inThe New York Timesand elsewhere. Dr. Obeyesekere denied being an imperialist, but Dr. Sahlins was not entirely wrong in saying that his colleague sought commonalities between East and West. Much of Dr. Obeyesekere’s work explored the ways in which different cultures shared certain universal qualities, including what he called “practical rationality,” a basic sense of seeing the world. Dr. Obeyesekere was a critical voice in debates about colonialism, pluralism and the possibility of finding commonalities across cultural divides. His willingness to take a critical eye to political beliefs in Sri Lanka made him something of a controversial figure at home, though he often laughed that off with self-deprecating humor. “For some of my critics I must seem a foolish person and also an ignorant one,” Dr. Obeyesekere said in a 2015 address at the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. “That indeed is true: In the course of my long intellectual life, I must have been sometimes a fool.”Though he built his reputation on ethnographic field work in Sri Lanka, his later studies moved away from conventional anthropology to encompass philosophy, sociology and literary criticism. In another of his major works, “The Awakened Ones: Phenomenology of Visionary Experience” (2012), he examined mysticism across a variety of cultures and periods. Touching on Hinduism, Buddhism and the poetry of William Blake, he found in them a similar embrace of a different kind of thinking. “That which is nonrational,” he said in 2015, “is not necessarily irrational.”Gananath Obeyesekere (pronounced GAH-na-nat Obey-SAY-kara) was born on Feb. 2, 1930, in Meegama, in the Western Province of what is now Sri Lanka. His family moved to Colombo, the capital, when he was 5 so that his father, Don Dharmadasa Obeyesekere, could teach traditional Indian, orAyurvedic medicine. His mother, Amara (Kannangara) Obeyesekere, died when Gananath was very young. He attended private schools run on the British model and steeped in British culture, then studied English literature at the University of Ceylon (which later split into four institutions). His grand intellectual mission, Dr. Obeyesekere said, was to study the way ideas from one culture filtered through another, whether it be South Asian culture through the West or vice versa. After graduating in 1955, he had the opportunity to attend Oxford to continue studying literature. But he had also grown interested in collecting stories and studying folklore in the countryside, and he opted to pursue anthropology instead. He married Ranjini Ellepola in 1958. Along with their son Asita, she survives him, as does another son, Indrajit; their daughter, Nalinika Obeyesekere; three grandchildren; and one great-grandson. Dr. Obeyesekere received his master’s and doctorate degrees, both in anthropology, from the University of Washington, where he also taught. He later taught at the University of California San Diego and at Princeton, where he was chairman of the anthropology department from 1980 until his retirement in 2000. His early work included “Land Tenure in Village Ceylon: A Sociological and Historical Study” (1967) and “The Cult of the Goddess Pattini” (1984), both of which delved into the culture and politics of his native country. Ina 2003 interview for the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Obeyesekere said his grand intellectual mission was to study the way ideas from one culture filtered through another, whether it be South Asian culture through the West or vice versa. “Even Buddhism was filtered through the West,” he said. “I am a product of that myself.”"

Reporting from ParisPossible Electoral Ban on Marine Le Pen Has France on EdgeA verdict Monday in an embezzlement trial is seen as a test of the country’s democracy — and the rule of law. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has tried and failed three times to become president. Now, even as her popularity rises, she may be barred from taking part in an election to lead France if she is found guilty of embezzlement on Monday. Such a verdict, far from certain, has been equated by Ms. Le Pen with a “political death” sentence and a “very violent attack on the will of the people.” It would ignite a major political storm at a time when the French Fifth Republic has appeared increasingly dysfunctional. On the one hand stands the principle, as Nicolas Barret, one of the prosecutors, put it in closing arguments last year, that “We are not here in a political arena but a legal one, and the law applies to all.”On the other hand lies the fear, expressed by some leading politicians, that a ban would undermine French democracy by feeding a suspicion that it is skewed against the growing forces of the hard right. “Madame Le Pen must be fought at the ballot box, not elsewhere,” Gérald Darmanin, a former center-right interior minister,wrote on Xin November. He is now the justice minister. Ms. Le Pen, 56, has steered her anti-immigrant party from its antisemitic roots toward the mainstream. The party, whose name she changed from the National Front to the National Rally, is now the largest single party in the National Assembly with 123 seats. Prosecutors have accused Ms. Le Pen and other members of the National Rally of embezzling some $4.8 million in European Union funds, essentially through no-show jobs at the European Parliament for lawmaker “assistants,” who were rarely there and worked as party staff. Campaign posters for Emmanuel Macron and Ms. Le Pen in France during the presidential election in 2022. Her share of the vote has steadily risen. Ms. Le Pen has denied the charges. Her lawyers argue that the 2016 law under which she can be automatically banned from running for office was not in place at the time of the alleged scheme, and that the people involved were political aides, not European Parliament employees. Ms. Le Pen was a member of that assembly from 2004 to 2017. The prosecution, led by Mr. Barret and Louise Neyton, has requested a five-year sentence for Ms. Le Pen, with three of those suspended; a 300,000-euro, or $325,000, fine; and a five-year ban with immediate effect on running for public office. The objective of Ms. Le Pen and her co-defendants was “bluntly put, to turn the European Parliament into their cash cow,” Ms. Neyton said last year. Even if Ms. Le Pen is convicted, the judges could waive any ban on running for office. If imposed, however, the disqualification would exclude her from the 2027 presidential election in which President Emmanuel Macron, a centrist, cannot run because he is term-limited. Ms. Le Pen ran in 2012, 2017 and 2022, steadily increasing her share of the vote to 41.45 percent. An ineligibility verdict against Ms. Le Pen could be appealed. But the appeals process is slow, and it is far from clear that a new trial would take place before the 2027 election, or that the prosecution’s case would be overturned. The National Rally has been reluctant to speculate on the consequences of a possible ban. Ms. Le Pen’s natural successor is Jordan Bardella, 29, a smooth-talking, unflappable protégé who Ms. Le Pen has said would be her prime minister if she were president. Jordan Bardella is seen as Ms. Le Pen’s natural successor if she is banned from running for president. When asked in a recent TV interview if he would run for president, absent Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Bardella punted: “She won’t be ineligible, so I don’t ask myself the question.”With the forces of the anti-immigrant right rising in Europe, now encouraged by the Trump administration, Ms. Le Pen is widely regarded as a strong candidate, perhaps even the favorite, for the 2027 vote, if eligible. Mr. Macron has not built a strong  party, so his departure will create a vacuum that more than a half-dozen men — including Mr. Darmanin and former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal — are scrambling to fill with their presidential ambitions. A chaotic snap parliamentary election last year, four prime ministers in the past 15 months, and a parliament paralyzed by its divisions have given the impression of a Fifth Republic hard pressed to provide coherent governance. Disqualification of Ms. Le Pen would inevitably intensify criticism from leading American officials, including Vice President JD Vance, of a supposed campaign by European states to stifle the far right and so quash democracy in the name of saving it. Hungarian and Italian democracies have delivered current leaders of, or descended from, the far right. But of course Europe has a visceral memory of just how fragile democratic institutions are, and how authoritarian extreme-right movements destroyed them not so long ago, precipitating a blood bath. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front and Ms. Le Pen’s father, repeatedly called the Holocaust a “detail” of history. She eventually expelled him from the party. Mr. Le Pen diedin January. If the verdict goes against Ms. Le Pen, the 2027 presidential election would be the first in almost 40 years that has not had a Le Pen on the ballot.

Reporting from TokyoHegseth Pledges to Step Up Military Cooperation With JapanThe U.S. defense secretary sought to reassure its ally over security ties and vowed to speed up the creation of a joint “war-fighting headquarters” to deter China. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth wrapped up hisfirst official visit to Asiaon Sunday by offering reassurances to Japan that President Trump wants a stronger military alliance in the region to deter an increasingly assertive China. Following an 85-minute meeting in Tokyo with his Japanese counterpart, Mr. Hegseth said the Trump administration would abide by promises to increase security cooperation with its staunch ally. This would include speeding up a Biden administration-era plan to create a new joint U.S.-Japan military command in Tokyo that he called a “war-fighting headquarters,” although Mr. Hesgeth did not say when it would become operational. He also said there would be more joint military exercises in the Okinawa islands near Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China says is part of its territory and has threatened to take by force. Mr. Hegseth arrived in Japan from the Philippines, another U.S. ally, where the defense secretary alsosought to allay anxietyabout the Trump administration’s commitment to the region. Japan has watched with concern as the United States has broken with traditionalallies in Europeto seek a deal that might allow Russia to keep territory seized from Ukraine. U.S. Marines training on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Japanese officials have worried in private that such concessions might encourage China to make a move on Taiwan. After the meeting with Gen Nakatani, the Japanese defense minister, Mr. Hegseth struck a strident tone about the alliance, proclaiming that the United States would work with Japan to secure “peace through strength” that will deter the Chinese from taking action. “America first does not mean America alone,” Mr. Hegseth told reporters. “America and Japan stand firmly together in the face of aggressive and coercive actions by the communist Chinese.” Mr. Hegseth did not address concerns about his sharing of military information on theSignal chat appthat included a journalist. Mr. Hegseth’s visit to Japan included a stop on the island of Iwo Jima, where American and Japanese forces fought one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. The U.S. defense secretary attended a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the battle, where he briefly met Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan visiting Mount Suribachi following a joint U.S.-Japan memorial service on Saturday to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima. The symbolism of the island visit was significant. It showed how two wartime foes had become close partners and came at a time that many Japanese feel the country is facing its most adverse security environment since 1945. Mr. Nakatani said he explained to Mr. Hegseth how Japan is responding to the challenges with a plan, which predates the Trump administration, to double its defense and other security spending by 2027. He told reporters that the two did not discuss new targets for Japan to further increase spending or step up contributions to pay for the 50,000-strong U.S. military presence in the nation. “I shared how Japan is, through our own part, making efforts to drastically strengthen our defense capabilities,” Mr. Nakatani said. After the meeting, Japanese defense ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to discuss these matters in public, said they were pleased with the talks. They said Mr. Hegseth had gone far in dispelling their concerns that President Trump might not honor commitments made by the previous administration. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth with his Japanese counterpart, Gen Nakatani, in Tokyo on Sunday. They said their biggest worry had been the fate of the joint command, a more than $1 billion project that some U.S. media had reported would be axed as part of the Trump administration’s cost cutting. The new headquarters will allow the two nations’ militaries to work more closely together during a crisis in the region around Japan. Mr. Hegseth called Japan “a model ally” that would work closely with the United States while building up its own military. “We’re confident that Japan will make the correct determination of what capabilities are needed,” he said. Analysts said the level of agreement reflected the extent to which Japan has shed its postwar pacifism in recent years, driven by the growingChinese military presencein the region as well as the nuclear buildup by North Korea. Mr. Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, has long called for the country to become a more fully-fledged military partner of the United States. “Trump wants Japan to do more, and Ishiba wants Japan to do more,” said Masato Kamikubo, a professor of international policy studies at Ritsumeikan University. “There’s a meeting of the minds between these two.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Prince Harry Accused of ‘Bullying’ by Chair of Charity He Co-founded,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/europe/prince-harry-accused-bullying-charity.html,2025-03-30T12:27:06Z,World,Sophie Chandauka claimed that Harry quit as patron of the organization to damage it after failing to oust her from the role following a series of board conflicts.,Boards of Directors; Philanthropy; Royal Families,"Harry, Duke of Sussex; Chandauka, Sophie; Markle, Meghan",Lesotho; Great Britain,Sentebale,"Prince Harry said that he resigned because the relationship between the board and Sophie Chandauka was broken “beyond repair.” Reporting from York, EnglandPrince Harry Accused of ‘Bullying’ by Chair of Charity He Co-foundedSophie Chandauka claimed that Harry quit as patron of the organization to damage it after failing to oust her from the role following a series of board conflicts. An ugly rift between Prince Harry and a leader of a charity he co-founded escalated on Sunday after the leader, Sophie Chandauka, accused the prince of engaging in harassment and bullying to try to force her out of her post. Ms. Chandauka said that when Harry abruptlyresignedlast week as the patron of the charity, Sentebale, it was calculated to damage the organization after he failed to oust her from her post as the chair of its board of trustees. “Can you imagine what that attack has done for me, on me, and the 540 individuals in the Sentebale organizations and their family?” Ms. Chandauka said in aninterviewwith the British broadcaster Sky News. “That is an example of harassment and bullying at scale.”A spokesman for Harry and his wife, Meghan, declined to comment on Ms. Chandauka’s latest claims, which she made on the Sky News program “Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips.”Sentebale was co-founded by the prince in 2006 to honor his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and to raise money to help young victims of the H.I.V. pandemic in Lesotho. It has expanded operations to nearby Botswana and works on issues ranging from substance abuse and gender-based violence to climate change, and how they affect young people. Harry, who is also known as the Duke of Sussex, announced his resignation, alongside the charity’s co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, last Wednesday, saying that the relationship between the board of trustees and Ms. Chandauka had ruptured irretrievably. Five of the board’s nine members had resigned earlier in the week. Sophie Chandauka described Harry’s resignation as an attack on the charity after failing to oust her as chair. Their departures followed a mounting series of conflicts between the board and Ms. Chandauka. The five board members had asked her to resign, saying they had lost “trust and confidence” in her. “It is devastating that the relationship between the charity’s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,” Harry and Prince Seeiso said in a joint statement when they announced their resignation. “We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale’s beneficiaries.”The dispute between board members and Ms. Chandauka has landed in an English court and with Britain’s Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales. Both sides have filed claims of wrongdoing. Although Sentebale operates in southern Africa, it is registered in Britain. Ms. Chandauka, a Zimbabwe-born lawyer who has worked for Morgan Stanley and the technology company Meta, was named as Sentebale’s chair in July 2023 and had previously served as a trustee from 2009 to 2015. Among the examples of mistreatment cited by Ms. Chandauka on Sky was an awkward incident, caught on video, after a polo match to raise money for the charity in Miami last April. During the presentation of awards onstage, Meghan appeared to ask Ms. Chandauka to switch places from her position next to Harry. That required her to duck under a trophy as she moved to stand next to Meghan, also known as the Duchess of Sussex, prompting news organizations to raise questions about Meghan’s behavior. “Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the duchess, and I said I wouldn’t,” Ms. Chandauka said. “Not because I didn’t care about the duchess, but because I knew what would happen if I did so, No. 1. And No. 2, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.”Ms. Chandauka said the site of the polo match had already been moved because Harry insisted on bringing a camera crew that was filming a documentary for Netflix, with which the couple has a production deal. Ms. Chandauka said that the drama surrounding the split between Harry and Meghan and the British royal family had become the greatest risk to the charity. As tensions with the Sussexes mounted, she said, she had been a victim of “this unleashing of the Sussex machine,” referring to Harry’s public relations team. For all her charges, Ms. Chandauka said her relationship with Harry had generally been “fantastic.” But she said, “There are some individuals on the board who thought they could get away with mistreating a woman.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

What We Know About Talks for a Renewed Gaza Cease-Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza.html,2025-03-30T12:26:39Z,World,"Hamas said it had accepted a proposal for a new cease-fire, which would see some hostages released from captivity in Gaza. But details were elusive.",International Relations; Israel-Gaza War (2023- ),"Netanyahu, Benjamin",Egypt; Gaza Strip; Israel,,"Visiting the graves of relatives in Gaza City on Sunday. Reporting from JerusalemWhat We Know About Talks for a Renewed Gaza Cease-FireHamas said it had accepted a proposal for a new cease-fire, which would see some hostages released from captivity in Gaza. But details were elusive. Israel and Hamas both signaled over the weekend that efforts for a renewed cease-fire in Gaza were underway, less than two weeks after the breakdown of a temporary truce and the resumption of Israel’s air and ground campaign against the militant group in the enclave. Hamas said on Saturday that it had accepted a proposal for a new cease-fire, which would see some hostages released from captivity in Gaza. Israel said it, too, had received a proposal via third-party mediators and had responded with a counterproposal in coordination with the United States. “The military pressure is working,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Sunday in remarks at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting, adding that Israel was “suddenly seeing cracks” in Hamas’s position. Since Israel resumed attacks on the Gaza Strip on March 18, over 900 people have been killed, the enclave’s health ministry said on Saturday. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Neither side published details of the proposal or the counterproposal, but an official briefed on the talks suggested that they broadly echoed previous proposals floated in recent weeks. While there was no indication that a breakthrough was imminent, the public statements suggested that after weeks of fruitless negotiations, contacts over a deal were proceeding even as the war continued. On Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said it had recovered the bodies of eight emergency medical technicians, five Civil Defense personnel and a United Nations employee in Rafah in southern Gaza. The medical organization said it had lost contact with nine of its crew members more than a week ago after they were directly fired upon by Israeli forces. The Israeli military said in a statement late Sunday that its forces had opened fire on March 23 at several vehicles that had been “advancing suspiciously” toward the troops without headlights or emergency signals and without prior coordination. The military added that an initial assessment had determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas operative and eight other “terrorists,” without explaining any connection to the emergency and rescue crew members who were killed. The Times could not independently verify the claims of either side. What did Hamas say? Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official and negotiator, said in a speech on Saturday that his group had received a proposal two days earlier from Egyptian and Qatari mediators for a renewed cease-fire, adding that Hamas had “responded positively and approved it.”He did not detail the terms, but recent negotiations, including an unusual round ofdirect talks between U.S. and Hamas officials, had focused on securing the release of Edan Alexander, the only Israeli American hostage still believed to be alive, as well as the bodies of four other Israeli Americans. That was a nonstarter for Israel, which had demanded the release of 10 or 11 living hostages for a seven-week extension of the temporary cease-fire, based on an earlier proposal it attributed to the White House Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Edan Alexander’s mother holding a poster of her son during a rally for families of hostages last month in Tel Aviv. What did Israel say? After Mr. al-Hayya’s speech on Saturday, Mr. Netanyahu said he had held a series of consultations on Friday after receiving the proposal, according to a statement from his office. Israel had sent a counterproposal to mediators a few hours earlier, the statement added. The official briefed on the talks, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate diplomacy, said that Israel still sought the release of 10 living hostages for any resumption of the cease-fire and that Egypt was behind the latest proposal. Up to 24 living hostages remain in Gaza, according to Israel, along with the remains of another 35 people. They were among the roughly 250 people taken captive during the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023 that ignited the war. What are the main sticking points? Beyond agreeing on the numbers of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be released, any renewed cease-fire will most likely be elusive so long as the two sides remain at odds over more fundamental issues — including irreconcilable demands about the future of Gaza. Mr. al-Hayya said Hamas was committed to reaching an agreement that would guarantee a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, general terms that the sides had already agreed upon to extend the truce that ultimately collapsed. “We do not want anything new,” Mr. al-Hayya said on Saturday. “We want to respect what was signed, what the guarantors guaranteed, and what the international community approved.”Israel has conditioned ending the war on Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing rule in Gaza. Mr. al-Hayya said the group’s “weapons of resistance” were a “red line” as long as Israel occupies Palestinian land. What has changed? Israel and Hamas have each blamed the other for the collapse of the first phase of the cease-fire that came into effect in mid-January. But both are now facing heightened pressure to renew the truce. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has come under pressure in his country. When the first phase of the cease-fire expired in early March, Israelhalted the entry of all commercial goods and humanitarian aidinto Gaza, worsening conditions for an already exhausted population in a bid to force Hamas into accepting atemporary extensionof the cease-fire instead of negotiating a permanent one. More than 50,000 Gazans have been killed so far in the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and much of the enclave is in ruins. Protests havesince broken out against Hamasin Gaza. An activist in the protest movement said he was worried that Hamas may accept another temporary cease-fire so that its security forces can come out of hiding and crack down on the protesters without fear of being attacked by Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has also come under domestic pressure. Many Israelis have accused him of failing to prioritize the hostages and prolonging the war in Gaza tokeep far-right members of his ruling coalitionon board to ensure his political survival. “We are committed to bringing the hostages home,” Mr. Netanyahu said on Sunday, rejecting the popular criticism. “The combination of military pressure and diplomatic pressure is the only thing that will bring the hostages back,” he added. Netanyahu Faces Fewer Restraints: President Trump is more aligned than his predecessoron Gaza with the aims of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his right-wing coalition. Skepticism About U.S.-Iran Talks: Many Israelis were surprisedwhen Trump announced that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran in an effortto rein in the country’s nuclearprogram. Attempt to Fire Israeli Spy Chief: Israel’s highest court began hearing a case over Netanyahu’s decision to replace one of his top intelligence chiefs — a courtroom battle thatcould open the door to a constitutional crisis.

Syrians Wake Up to a New Government,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/middleeast/syria-new-transitional-government.html,2025-03-30T10:58:07Z,World,"The list of ministers appears to be a compromise between calls for a diverse cabinet to unite the divided country while keeping allies of the interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, in powerful roles.",War and Armed Conflicts; Politics and Government,"al-Shara, Ahmed (Abu Mohammad al-Jolani) (1982- ); Assad, Bashar al-",Idlib (Syria); Syria,Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS),"Syrians at a market in Damascus last month. The long-awaited transitional government was announced late on Saturday. Reporting from Damascus, SyriaSyrians Wake Up to a New GovernmentThe list of ministers appears to be a compromise between calls for a diverse cabinet to unite the divided country while keeping allies of the interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, in powerful roles. A new caretaker government announced late on Saturday by Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, appeared to be a compromise, meeting calls for more diversity even as he kept the most powerful ministries for his associates and allies. The rebels whooverthrew President Bashar al-Assadin December have since been acting as Syria’s de facto authorities, naming their leader, Mr. al-Shara,interim presidentto oversee a transitional government. Mr. al-Shara announced the much anticipated new government late on Saturday night, swearing in 23 cabinet ministers in a ceremony that ran into the early hours of Sunday — the last day in Syria of the fasting month of Ramadan before the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. On Sunday, Syrians were accepting with some resignation the continued dominance of the rebel group that seized power in December but welcoming its inclusion of independent voices and wider representation. Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, speaking on Saturday in Damascus. He had been under pressure from Western countries and Syria’s civil society to form an inclusive government. Among Mr. al-Shara’s appointees are seven ministers affiliated with the provincial administration he once led in the rebel-held city of Idlib. But he also appointed nine independent ministers, among them technocrats and former activists, and included five ministers who served in the early years of the Assad regime before the country descended into civil war. He named ministers from each of the main ethnic minorities, Kurds, Druze, Christians and Alawites, the sect of Mr. al-Assad. Among them was the lone female minister, Hind Kabawat, who is Christian, to lead the Ministry of Social Affairs. “No doubt some voices will feel excluded still,” Abdy Yeganeh, policy director at the Independent Diplomat, a London-based nonprofit advisory group, said ahead of the swearing-in ceremony. But overall, he said, “there is a sense of cautious optimism with the transition in Syria, including with the announcement of the new government.”Mr. al-Shara had been under pressure from Western countries and from members of Syria’s civil society to form an inclusive government. Those calls took on greater urgency after sectarian violence erupted this month among Alawite communities in Syria’s coastal region. “There is a need to widen the circle,” Ibrahim al-Assil, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said ahead of the announcement, referring to Mr. al-Shara’s small circle of allies that had been running the transitional government since December. “There is a need to be more inclusive, from one perspective to reflect Syrian society, and from another because they need them. They cannot run the show on their own.”For many Syrians, closely following the makeup of the government and studying ministers’ biographies was a novel experience. Several of the new ministers hold degrees from Western universities or served under the Assad regime. Among the former Assad officials are Yarab Badr, the new transportation minister, a civil engineer who earned a doctorate in transportation sciences in Paris, and Nidal al-Shaar,  an international banker and economist, who was named economic minister. At least two ministers had been detained as political prisoners under the Assad government, including the new justice minister, Madhhar al-Weys, who promised to establish the rule of law and pursue transitional justice for victims of Mr. al-Assad’s oppression. Still, Mr. al-Shara made sure to keep much of the power of the state close at hand. He left close allies leading the ministries of defense and foreign affairs, and moved his former intelligence chief, Anas Khattab, 38, to head the Interior Ministry. In a speech on Saturday night, Mr. al-Shara said his main aim was to unite the country. “Together as a people and a government we will build a strong country,” he said, to “work through our hardships and create a Syria we deserve.”His appointments reflect the balancing act that Mr. al-Shara has been trying to toe. He has been grappling with insurgencies from remnants of the Assad regime and from the Islamic State — both of which threaten to exacerbate sectarian and ethnic divisions in the country. Mr. al-Shara is also seeking to avert regional tensions with neighboring countries, and to persuade Western countries to ease sanctions imposed during Mr. al-Assad’s regime. He has come under intense scrutiny because some of the groups allied to him — and on which he relies for security — are designated by the United States and others as terrorist groups, according to analysts. The Trump administration, alongside other Western governments, has made any further lifting of sanctions conditional on Mr. al-Shara’s commitment to fighting terrorism and on specific action against foreign jihadists in militias aligned with him, Mr. Yeganeh of the Independent Diplomat said. Mr. al-Shara is also balancing complex geopolitical pressures from regional players that could destabilize the country. Israel and Turkey have vied for influence in Syria, and both have used military strikes in recent weeks to reinforce their presence in the country.

Reporting from BangkokIn Myanmar, Aftershocks and Military Airstrikes Terrorize ResidentsNew tremors rattled survivors of Friday’s earthquake, which killed more than 1,600 people, while the government continued its bombing campaign elsewhere in the country. Myo Zaw and his team of volunteer rescue workers were the first to arrive at the site where a three-story house had collapsed in Mandalay, a little after 8 p.m. on Saturday. They were digging through the rubble with their bare hands when they heard the voice of a girl. It was faint but clear. “Help me, I’m here,” she said. It took them three or four hours to pull out the 12-year-old, who had survived despite the house toppling around her. But in the early hours of Sunday morning, there was only silence as the rescuers continued to work in nearly 100-degree heat. They eventually unearthed three bodies: the girl’s mother and her grandparents. “Sadly, I fear we will find more bodies than survivors,” Mr. Myo Zaw said. “The heat in Mandalay is intense, causing rapid decomposition. In some cases, we locate the bodies only because of the smell.”Time is running short in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city with about 1.5 million people, which is near the epicenter of Friday’s devastating earthquake. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Across the country, over 1,600 people were confirmed dead, as of Saturday night, and over 3,000 injured in the worst earthquake to hit Myanmar in more than a century. Many fear that the number of people who can be rescued will dwindle after Monday evening, the crucial 72-hour mark after which experts say the chances of survival drop sharply. Even as volunteer rescuers scoured the ruins of homes, monasteries and mosques, and hospitals overflowed with patients, aftershocks — including a strong one on Sunday — kept residents on edge. Several buildings in Mandalay that had survived Friday’s powerful earthquake toppled on Sunday. In Photos and VideosAnd the military made clear it would not stop a brutal bombing campaign in a civil war that has ravaged the country despite the urgent need for relief efforts, with reports of an airstrike on Sunday afternoon in Pakokku Township in Magway Region in the country’s northwest that killed two women and injured seven others. How the military government and its commander in chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, an already deeply unpopular leader who ousted a civilian government four years ago, respond in the coming days and weeks could determine the junta’s hold on power. The military government has already lost ground to rebels in the civil war, which had left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people in need of shelter and food even before the quake, according to United Nations officials. Rescue teams working in Mandalay, Myanmar, on Saturday, a day after the earthquake struck. Mandalay is near the epicenter of the quake. In the early hours after the earthquake, a lack of machinery and personnel severely hampered rescue operations. But the arrival of Chinese rescue teams with heavy equipment on Saturday night has given volunteers a glimmer of hope. On Sunday, volunteers rescued 29 people from a collapsed apartment building in Mandalay and recovered eight bodies, according to Soe Paing, a rescue worker from the Myanmar fire service department. He said the help from the Chinese had sped up the work. “Right now, we believe around 90 people are still trapped inside,” he said, “and we are doing everything we can to get them out alive.”Later in the day, an aftershock struck Mandalay, sending residents into the streets, screaming in fear. Many are confronting an uncertain future, rationing food and wondering how they can get by without any power and scarce water. Volunteers asked for more body bags for the corpses that they are pulling out by the hour. Many have said that the army has done little to help. Aid from other countries has also begun arriving, but questions remain about how the Myanmar Army would distribute the much-needed relief. At least half a dozen nations, including India, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore and Thailand, have sent teams and supplies. Some of the aid, such as a group from Singapore and supplies from India, has gone to Naypyidaw, the capital, where the military’s generals live and which was less affected than Mandalay. “They have a long track record of using aid as a weapon,” Scot Marciel, the U.S. ambassador to Myanmar from 2016 to 2020, said of the military government. “I would think that they would try to use it to funnel aid to their supporters and prevent it from getting to people in the areas controlled by the resistance. I don’t have faith in them that they would do the right thing.”Chinese rescue team members, in blue, searching for victims in Mandalay on Sunday. Aid from China arrived Saturday night. Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the spokesman for the rebel Karen National Union, said the group welcomed the support of foreign countries but warned them to be “aware of the nature of the military in our country.”He pointed out that the military had not refrained from attacks even after the earthquake, saying: “They might use the money for the war. We worry about this issue.”Control of Myanmar is now divided between the military regime, which governs the urban areas, and the ethnic armies, which hold the borderlands. Since the 2021 coup, Sagaing — another region that has been hit hard by the earthquake — has also emerged as a center of resistance and is home to a patchwork of rebel groups. (Internet access has been cut off in Sagaing, making it difficult to get reports from there.)An hour after Friday’s earthquake, a military paramotor, or motor-powered paraglider, dropped bombs in Chaung Oo village in Sagaing, said Phyu Win, a resident. “People were already terrified from the quake, and with the chaos, it was impossible to take cover in bomb shelters,” she said. The army’s airplanes have continued to fly overhead since the earthquake. “The junta has no interest in helping people,” Ms. Phyu Win said. “They only want to kill.”At one point last year, the rebels had advanced close to Mandalay, which was seen by many to be a potential tipping point in the war. Damage in Mandalay on Sunday. Experts say the earthquake could change the trajectory of the civil war. The National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile, has called for a two-week pause in fighting, but it does not speak for the multiple rebel groups and ethnic armies fighting government forces. The powerful Arakan Army, which has won control of large parts of Rakhine State in Myanmar, could exploit this moment to wrest the south of the country away from the junta. Much will also depend on how General Min Aung Hlaing and his military view this moment. “Their backs are to the wall and they can’t cope,” Khin Zaw Win, a political analyst and director of the Tampadipa Institute, a research group in Yangon, said of the military leaders. “We have come to the point where the military will be forced to relent.”Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar for the International Crisis Group, called the earthquake “a moment of jeopardy for Min Aung Hlaing.”“It’s really a critical moment for him, his legacy, but also his current regime,” Mr. Horsey said. “He doesn’t exactly know how this is going to play out — it’s difficult to guess — but he knows that there will be huge political aftershocks.”Verena Hölzlcontributed reporting from Bangkok."

She is a woman, not a man. Wreckage of a crane being removed by heavy machinery on Sunday in Bangkok at the site where a building under construction collapsed. Reporting from BangkokIn Bangkok, Looking at High-Rises With a New Sense of DreadBuildings are rising all over the city, emblems of economic growth. But an earthquake that sent one crashing to the ground has stirred fears about building safety. When the earth started rocking beneath her home in Bangkok on Friday, Kanittha Thepasak thought she was simply dizzy. Then she heard an odd creaking sound, saw a lamp moving and threw aside a curtain to find cars swaying like boats at sea. The streets were filled with people who had rushed outside, staring up at the apartment buildings, glass office towers and unfinished construction all around them. Now Ms. Kanittha can barely imagine returning to the office where she spends most of her days. It’s on the 29th floor. “I’m freaked out, I’m worried,” she said. “Thai people have no basic understanding of earthquakes because we never really experience them.”The quake that devastated Myanmar on Friday did far less damage in neighboring Thailand, but the sheer force of it — with a magnitude of 7.7 — emptied Bangkok, a city of towers, into the streets. On Sunday, two days later, as the Thai government and engineersinspectedhundreds of damaged structures to ensure they could be occupied, it was still darkening thoughts of routines that increasingly include living and working dozens of stories above ground. The disaster’s most devastating scene in Thailand came from the complete collapse of a Bangkok building that had been under construction. At least 11 workers were reported dead as of Sunday, and with about 75 still unaccounted for, rescue crews continued to pull carefully at the rubble with a dozen excavators and eight dogs trained to find the dead and the living. In Photos and VideosAndy Redmond, a member of the K9 team, said all the signals on Sunday pointed to cadavers, with a scent so overwhelming that the dogs struggled to locate individual remains. “It’s a learning curve,” he said, resting between search missions that had kept him at the site since Friday afternoon. “You can’t train for this.”Video of the building’s dramatic fall seems etched in the minds of many, altering how residents see their city. For about a decade, Bangkok has been on the move, upward and outward, with a construction boom fueled by the expansion of its subway and Skytrain. But now, with at least a dozen cranes hovering over the skyline, gray skeletons of steel and concrete that once signaled economic growth have taken on an ominous quality. Somreutal Nilbanjong, 34, found herself gazing at one such building downtown on Sunday afternoon as she walked home. Asked what she was thinking, she said, “It scares me just to look at it.”A small construction elevator climbed up the exterior through pink scaffolding. She scrolled through her phone until she found a photo of the mountain of rubble a few miles away — the collapsed building, Bangkok’s ground zero. Goose bumps appeared on her arms, and she shuddered. “I’m afraid it’s going to happen again,” she said. An aerial view of the building that collapsed. Government officials have tried to calm people’s nerves and keep people updated. Immediately after Friday’s quake, Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, issued an urgent alert warning people to be wary of aftershocks for the next 24 hours. By that evening, she sought to reassure the public by announcing that the situation had stabilized and that residents could return to their homes. On Saturday, she rode on Bangkok’s elevated railway, known as the Skytrain, to show that the trains were safe. The system had been shut down after the quake and inspected before most of the lines were reopened. But even as the city has re-emerged toward normalcy — malls and markets full, trains rumbling over streets packed with motorbikes — many people are struggling to process something they had thought happened only in other places, like Japan or Taiwan. Ms. Kanittha said the experience was so confounding that her mind raced to memories of what she had seen in Japanese comics or manga depicting  disasters. Many people said they weren’t necessarily scared, but that they were forced to ask unexpected questions: Behind glass facades, are buildings really secure? What if there are cracks that cannot be seen? What if there’s a giant aftershock? Jiraporn Jaichob, 41, a drink stall owner who was having lunch when the temblor struck, said she was making plans for future disasters. She was thinking of buying a transistor radio since she’d seen cellphone coverage go down. She also created a go bag for family with key documents and supplies. “With this earthquake we learned that we don’t know what might happen in a given day,” she said. “We can die anytime, anywhere, I know, it’s our fate,” she added. “But at least we take care of our lives where we can.”Damage to a bridge connecting two high-rise condominium buildings in Bangkok. Thailand upgraded its earthquake-resistant building code in 2007, and experts said the vast majority of the city’s buildings were clearly strong enough to withstand what should still be considered a rare seismic event. Still, some engineers called for greater scrutiny and a potential upgrade in standards and enforcement. “Look at Japan — they keep developing their laws and design,” said Suchatvee Suwansawat, a professor of civil engineering at King Mongkut University and a former president of the Council of Engineers Thailand. “We should do that as well.”The collapse of the 30-story building, which had been going up beside a mall and popular weekend market, could be a turning point. It never should have buckled, said Dr. Suchatvee, suggesting that something went wrong in design, execution or oversight. Four years into construction, it was being built by a Chinese state-owned company, the China Railway 10th Engineering Group. The Thai government has promised to investigate and report early findings in a week. But like other frightening building collapses — the condo tower in Surfside, Fla., which killed 98 people in 2021; or the downing of the World Trade Center from terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 — the toll of destruction seems likely to linger. By dusk Sunday, shock, grief and dust mingled in the air at the collapse site, where a sizable crowd was gathered. Volunteer rescuers from the police and the military wearing jumpsuits cycled in and out of the area. At one point, a crane held two observers over the top of the rubble mountain as men in yellow hats stared up from below. Waiting for news of the search operations at the site of the building collapse in Bangkok. At the perimeter, the father of a Pakistani worker told reporters people were praying at temples all over Thailand, and that he hoped at least half the workers would come out alive. Aubonrat Setnawet was also still hoping for good news about her husband. He had been on the 23rd floor of the building when the earthquake hit; she had been there too, working, but on the ground floor, not far from where she sat on Sunday in a soft plastic chair near a hard metal fence. “No updates,” she said quietly. All she could point to were more relatives beside her, as the noisy grind of diggers and dump trucks filled the air. At the market across the street, Jatupol Sawangphanich, 42, put tape over the slits of a metal grate protecting his tropical fish business. “Every time they lift the rubble, the dust flies in this direction,” he said. Beside him, the lights of a usually busy mall had gone dark. Its structural integrity still needed to be tested. “This happened all over Bangkok,” he said. “I’d rather not go into tall buildings at all.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

It was Kyrgyzstan, not Kazakhstan. Reporting from Doha, Qatar‘They Will Label Us as Spies’: The Afghan Students Abandoned by AmericaStudents at the American University of Afghanistan in Qatar fear having to return to their Taliban-ruled homeland after aid and visa cutoffs by the Trump administration. When she finds it hard to focus, Nilab jots down her worries on slips of paper and pins them to her wall, a strategy she picked up in a seminar on mental health at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul. She makes a mental note to deal with the issues at a scheduled time and then gets back to studying. That kept her sane when theU.S.-backed Afghan government was overthrown in 2021, when the Taliban made it illegal for women to receive an education and when she left in July 2023 to study at the university’s campus-in-exile in Qatar. Now, in Nilab’s dorm room in Doha, the little notes are stacking up. The Trump administration’s shutdown of foreign aid and refugee admissions has left her terrified that she will be forced to return to Afghanistan. There, she would be alone and deprived of any rights as a woman. Her hard-earned American-style education would be all but worthless. She imagines the worst. “How can girls go back to Afghanistan?” said Nilab, 30, who asked that only her first name be used to protect her identity. “What will happen to us? Rape, forced marriage and death.”On Jan. 20, just as Nilab was planning her final project for her cybersecurity degree, President Trump signed an executive ordersuspending refugee resettlement. The U.S. government had promised refugee status for her and her classmates, but Nilab’s hopes of rejoining her family, who received asylum in the United States after the Taliban took over, were shattered. Students from Afghanistan attending an online class in Education City. A month later, her university lost most of its funding when Mr. TrumpdismantledAmerican foreign aid programs, to reorient spending in line with the administration’s foreign policy goals. Funding was partly restored on March 16, the university’s leadership said, but only enough to operate into June. If the university closes, students will lose their housing, cafeteria meal plans and Qatari student visas. A third thunderbolt came on March 15, with word that Mr. Trump was considering putting Afghanistan on alistof countries whose citizens would be barred from entering the United States. Nilab does not know when she will ever see her family again, much less resettle with them. As she and other Afghan students find their lives thrown into chaos, they are caught between the infinite possibilities promised by a university education and a crushing sense that there are no doors left to open. “I thought this long journey was finished,” she said. “I was wrong.”With midterms approaching, Nilab has little time for her concerns. She has a presentation on arrays and algorithms due soon. So she writes down her fears and pins them to her bulletin board. Piece of AmericaThe American University of Afghanistan was established in 2006 as a coed liberal arts college, with instruction in English. It was designed to educate the next generation of Afghan leaders and innovators, imbued with Western ideals of justice, freedom and democracy. Students called their campus “Little America.”The U.S. government has invested more than $100 million in the university, and until last month, funding from the United States Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D., covered more than half of its operating costs. (The agency has also provided scholarships for more than 100 Afghan women — including Nilab’s sister — to study at universities in Oman and Qatar, among them the American University, and those students face a similar budget freeze.)Graduates at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul in 2019. When the American military hastily withdrew from the country in August 2021 and the Taliban returned to power, the American University was an obvious target. Militants rampaged through its buildings, scrawling graffiti that derided students as “U.S.-trained infidel spies” and “wolves in sheep’s skin.”Administrators worked to get more than 1,000 students out of the country as quickly as possible. Nearly 700 were evacuated to sister universities in Iraq, Kyrgyzstan and the United States. The government of Qatar agreed tohosta temporary campus-in-exile. One hundred students arrived for the term starting in August 2022, and another 100 — Nilab’s group — landed a year later. Most of the students eventually left for the United States on so-called Priority 1 visas. When Mr. Trump took office in January, the remaining 35 were waiting for their final interviews and pre-departure medical checkups. Some already had airplane tickets. They now wander the near-empty halls of their temporary campus in a stunned daze, not knowing what will happen next. “We thought all our traumas were finally coming to an end, so we could start to breathe again,” said Waheeda Babakarkhail, 23, a programmer who dreams of working as a white hat hacker, testing computer programs for security flaws. “I had accepted that I couldn’t stay in Afghanistan,” she said, “but now even the future I thought I would have has been lost.”Waheeda Babakarkhail, of Afghanistan, playing with her 2-year-old son, Noah, at the Qatar National Library in Education City. Aspirations have been derailed across the campus. Abbas Ahmadzai, 24, a business major, had a job in event management lined up in New York. Faisal Popalzai, 23, was hoping to get a job at Microsoft. He developed an A.I.-assisted computer program that can identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions. The app, called Hawks.Ai, won the Microsoft Hackathon last year in Doha. If pathways to the United States are cut, Mr. Popalzai said, the country will lose a valuable investment: “our minds, paid for by the American people.”Sense of DreadIf the university is forced to close in June, the students face an alarming prospect. They will lose their student visas and their right to stay in Qatar within weeks. If they cannot find a Qatari employer to sponsor them, or obtain a job or scholarship offer in another country, they will have to return to Afghanistan. Afghan students in Doha have found their lives thrown into chaos, as they are caught between the infinite possibilities promised by a university education and a crushing sense that there are no doors left to open. They are keenly aware that “the way we were educated is in contradiction to everything the Taliban represent,” said Hashmatullah Rahimi, 24, a business major. “We were taught to speak freely, to be independent. Not a single person in the Taliban government wants that.”The university’s administrators say there has been no documented persecution of its graduates since the Taliban takeover. But students fear they would be viewed as a threat. “If we go back,” Mr. Popalzai said, “they will label us as spies, sent to infect Afghans against the Taliban with our American ideology.”For female students, the risks are obvious. The Taliban havebanned educationfor women and girls after sixth grade and barred women from most forms of employment. They cannot travel without a male relative, they are required to cover their faces outside the home, and their voices must not be heard in public. “Maybe we won’t be killed if we go back,” said Rawina Amiri, 24, a business major who dreams of becoming a professional volleyball player. Rawina Amiri, of Afghanistan, and her husband studying at the Qatar National Library. “Does that mean we should accept having our rights violated?” she added. “We have the right to learn, to contribute, to work. Do people in the United States expect us to give up those rights because the Americans promised us a visa, then changed their mind?”Nilab remains in limbo in the U.S. visa process. On Tuesday, a U.S. Court of Appeals panelruledthat the Trump administration must admit thousands of people granted refugee status before Jan. 20, which could include several of the university’s students. But the ruling is preliminary and could be reversed. What has really thrown Nilab for a loop is the potential for Afghans to be included in a travel ban. She has not seen her parents and younger siblings since they moved to Northern Virginia. They were granted asylum because her parents had worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan. But because she was an adult, she was not eligible to join them. Nilab tries to hold on to hope, relying on the coping skills she picked up as a freshman four years ago. She is applying for scholarships in Europe even as she studies for her exams. “The Quran says that when one door is shut, another opens,” she said. “But if you don’t knock, the doors won’t open.”Nilab praying at a mosque in Education City after breaking her fast this month during Ramadan.

Key Takeaways From America’s Secret Military Partnership With Ukraine,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/europe/us-ukraine-military-war-takeaways.html,2025-03-30T04:01:11Z,World,An investigation by The New York Times has revealed that America was woven into the war far more than previously known.,Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022); United States International Relations; United States Defense and Military Forces; Missiles and Missile Defense Systems; Espionage and Intelligence Services,"Biden, Joseph R Jr; Zelensky, Volodymyr; Putin, Vladimir V; Syrsky, Oleksandr; Zaluzhny, Valery; Trump, Donald J",Ukraine; Wiesbaden (Germany); United States,Central Intelligence Agency; Defense Department; Defense Intelligence Agency; National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; National Security Agency; North Atlantic Treaty Organization; United States Army; United States Navy,"Ukrainian soldiers firing a howitzer at Russian armored vehicles. Key Takeaways From America’s Secret Military Partnership With UkraineAn investigation by The New York Times has revealed that America was woven into the war far more than previously known. The war in Ukraine is at an inflection point, with President Trump seeking rapprochement with the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, and pressing for an end to the fighting. But for nearly three years before Mr. Trump’s return to power, the United States and Ukraine were joined in an extraordinary partnership of intelligence, strategy, planning and technology whose evolution and inner workings have been known only to a small circle of American and allied officials. With remarkable transparency, the Pentagon has offered a public accounting of the $66.5 billion in weaponry it has supplied to Ukraine. But aNew York Times investigationreveals that America’s involvement in the war was far deeper than previously understood. The secret partnership both guided big-picture battle strategy and funneled precise targeting information down to Ukrainian soldiers in the field. Here are five takeaways from the investigation. A U.S. base in Wiesbaden, Germany, supplied the Ukrainians with the coordinates of Russian forces on their soil. The idea behind the partnership was that America’s close cooperation with Ukraine would compensate for Russia’s vast advantages in manpower and weaponry. To guide the Ukrainians as they deployed their ever-more-sophisticated arsenal, the Americans created an operation called Task Force Dragon. The secret center of the partnership was at the U.S. Army garrison in Wiesbaden, Germany. Each morning, U.S. and Ukrainian military officers set targeting priorities — Russian units, pieces of equipment or infrastructure. American and coalition intelligence officers searched satellite imagery, radio emissions and intercepted communications to find Russian positions. Task Force Dragon then gave the Ukrainians the coordinates so they could shoot at them. Military officials worried that it might be unduly provocative to call the targets “targets.” Instead they were referred to as “points of interest.”U.S. intelligence and artillery helped Ukraine quickly turn the tide against the Russian invasion. In spring 2022, the Biden administration agreed to send High Mobility Artillery Systems, or HIMARS, which used satellite-guided rockets for strikes up to 50 miles distant. In the war’s first year, the Ukrainians were extremely dependent on the Americans for intelligence, and Task Force Dragon vetted and oversaw virtually every HIMARS strike. The strikes caused Russian casualty rates to soar, and Ukraine’s 2022 counteroffensive was largely successful: By December, the Ukrainians held an unlikely, David-versus-Goliath upper hand against their Russian foe. The Biden administration kept moving its red lines. From the first, administration officials sought to lay down a red line: America was not fighting Russia; it was helping Ukraine. Still, they worried that steps taken to accomplish that might provoke Mr. Putin to attack N.A.T.O. targets or perhaps make good on his nuclear threats. Even as the administration developed an ever-greater tolerance of risk to help Ukraine meet the evolving threat, many of the most potentially provocative steps were taken in secret. Easing a prohibition against American boots on Ukrainian ground, Wiesbaden was allowed to put about a dozen military advisers in Kyiv. To avoid drawing public attention to their presence, the Pentagon initially called them “subject matter experts.” Later the team was expanded, to about three dozen, and the military advisers were eventually allowed to travel to Ukrainian command posts closer to the fighting. In 2022, the U.S. Navy was authorized to share targeting information for Ukrainian drone strikes on warships just beyond the territorial waters of Russian-annexed Crimea. The C.I.A. was allowed to support Ukrainian operations within Crimean waters; that fall, the spy agency covertly helped Ukrainian drones strike Russian warships in the port of Sevastopol. In January 2024, U.S. and Ukrainian military officers in Wiesbaden jointly planned a campaign — using coalition-supplied long-range missiles, along with Ukrainian drones — to attack about 100 Russian military targets across Crimea. The campaign, named Operation Lunar Hail, largely succeeded in forcing the Russians to pull equipment, facilities and forces in Crimea back to the Russian mainland. Ultimately, the U.S. military and C.I.A. were allowed to help with strikes into Russia. The hardest red line was the Russian border. But in spring 2024, to protect the northern city of Kharkiv against a Russian assault, the administration authorized the creation of an “ops box” — a zone of Russian territory within which U.S. officers in Wiesbaden could provide the Ukrainians with precise coordinates. The box’s first iteration extended across a wide swath of Ukraine’s northern border. The box was expanded after North Korea sent troops to help fight the Ukrainians’ incursion into Russia’s Kursk region. The U.S. military was later allowed to enable missile strikes in an area of southern Russia where the Russians staged forces and equipment for their offensive in eastern Ukraine. Longstanding policy barred the C.I.A. from providing intelligence on targets on Russian soil. But the C.I.A. could request “variances,” carve-outs to support strikes for specific objectives. Intelligence had identified a vast munitions depot in Toropets, 290 miles north of the Ukrainian border. On Sept. 18, 2024, a swarm of drones slammed into the munitions depot. The blast, as powerful as a small earthquake, opened a crater the width of a football field. Later, the C.I.A. was allowed to enable Ukrainian drone strikes in southern Russia to try to slow advances in eastern Ukraine. Political disagreements in Ukraine contributed to the 2023 counteroffensive’s collapse. The 2023 counteroffensive was meant to build momentum after the first year’s triumphs. But after the partners held war games in Wiesbaden and agreed on a strategy, the plan ran headlong into Ukrainian politics. The Ukrainian armed forces chief, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, embraced the plan, whose centerpiece was an assault in the direction of the southern city of Melitopol that would cut off Russian supply lines. But his rival and subordinate, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, had his own plan — to impale Russian forces in the occupied eastern city of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky,sided with him and divided up the ammunition and forces between two main fronts instead of one. The Ukrainians never did reclaim Bakhmut, and within months, the counteroffensive ended in failure. Russia now had the upper hand.

French Schools Will Finally Teach Sex Education,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/europe/france-sex-education-schools.html,2025-03-30T04:01:06Z,World,"For 25 years, France has said schools must teach sex ed. Now the government is at last putting a curriculum in place.",#MeToo Movement; Sex Education; Gender,,France,,"An earlier version of this article misstated the equivalent of 620 million euros in U.S. dollars. It is $670 million, not $67 million. Elisabeth Borne, France’s education minister, at a sex education class at a school in Bordeaux, France. Reporting from ParisFrench Schools Will Finally Teach Sex EducationFor 25 years, France has said schools must teach sex ed. Now the government is at last putting a curriculum in place. Students in France will learn about something new starting in September: sex, gender stereotypes and consent. Nearly a quarter-century after the French government passed a law mandating — but never putting in place — sex education for every student, it has finally developed and approved a curriculum for sex education classes, with a plan for teacher training and course materials. “We have been waiting 25 years for this,” said Sarah Durocher, president of Le Planning Familial, a French equivalent of Planned Parenthood — one of three nonprofit organizations thatsued the government in 2023for not implementing its own law. That lawsuit has yet to be resolved in court. But the government pushed the curriculum through on its own, over the protests of opponents who criticized it as “ideological brainwashing” andharmful to children’s development. More than 100 senators with the conservative party Les Républicains signedan op-ed, published in Le Figaronewspaper, opposing the program’s “woke ideology” and demanding all mentions of “gender identity” be removed. But Elisabeth Borne, the education minister, called the new program “absolutely essential.”She highlighted the findings of anindependent commission, which showed that one child in France is sexually abused every three minutes, mostly by a male member of their family. Many kids nowlearn about sex from online pornography sites, she pointed out. Although the curriculum is set to take effect in September, opponents are still fighting; a coalition of a few groups have filed a lawsuit to stop it before France’s top administrative court. Activists and experts say adoption of the curriculum was propelled by changing attitudes in France about sex since the #MeToo movement. “Public opinion now understands it’s necessary to talk to children about this kind of thing, because otherwise they will stay silent,” said Yves Verneuil, a professor of education at the University of Lyon. “The ministry, consequently, saw this change of mentality.”The highly publicized trial last fall of dozens of men,found guiltyof raping a woman namedGisèle Pelicotwhile she was deeply sedated, also had an effect, experts say. The case ignited discussions across the country about the casual banality of rape, the objectification of women and the lack of understanding of what consent is, and how it should be given before sex. “How could those men have said they got consent when seeing a drugged, passed-out woman?” Ms. Durocher said. “It raised the question of how we teach consent.”On paper, the French government has offered sex education since 1973. But the courses were optional and parents could pull their children from them, explained Mr. Verneuil, the professor, who has writtena bookon the history of sex education in France. In 2001, the government introduced a law specifically requiring three annual sessions of sexual education for every student. Subsequent governments expanded the course contents to include not just classes on STDs and the risks of pregnancy, but sexism, homophobia, sexual violence and the concept of consent, Mr. Verneuil said. However, no specific curriculum was developed, no budget or specialized training introduced and no personnel put in place to teach the classes, said Audrey Chanonat, a leader of the French union representing the principals of middle and high schools. Activists and experts say adoption of the curriculum was propelled by the #MeToo movement, as well as the highly publicized Pelicot trial last fall. At the middle school in Cognac where she is a principal, those courses required more than 100 hours of staff time. “I don’t have the personnel for it,” she said, noting that the staff did cover some of the topics in ninth-grade biology. “A real education program for sexual and intimate relationships with three hours per class? That exists almost nowhere,” Ms. Chanonat said. A2021 reportby the auditing department of the Ministry of Education, Sport and Research confirmed Ms. Chanonat’s point: Only 15 to 20 percent of French students were offered those three classes a year. “It is clear that many students go through their entire schooling without having benefited from a single lesson,” the report statedThe French feminist philosopher Camille Froidevaux-Metterie said the failure to put sex education in schools reveals a deep social conservatism in France. “Education about sex, but also about emotional and sexual relations, is learning to respect others and the difference between genders and sexualities,” she said. “And that pushes against a Conservative tradition that has always existed in France.”The government did keep trying to implement its law, but each time, it was met by fierce opposition, Ms. Froidevaux-Metterie said. In 2014, after the government trained teachers in 10 school districts to detect gender stereotypes and help children overcome them for a pilot program, some parents organized boycotts and pulled children out of school for two days. Activists who opposed gay marriage said the program woulddestroy the traditional heterosexual family model and teach children they could choose their gender. After one teacher was targeted on social media with personal threats, the program was cut, said Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, who was the country’s minister of women’s rights at the time. The same opponents protested and circulated petitions this past fall and winter, opposing teaching on gender identity. Ludovine de la Rochère, the co-founder of France’s major anti-gay marriage movement in the early 2010s that later led the opposition to the sex education program, told a Catholic radio station the program would introduce to children the possibility of gender transition. Her organization is part of the coalition that has sued to stop the first sex education classes this fall. The new curriculum, published last month in the official bulletin of the Ministry of Education, focuses on the themes of equality between men and women, the fight against discrimination, the principle of consent, and the prevention of sexism and sexual violence. Though they consider the curriculum cause for celebration, the activists who have been fighting for it have not withdrawn their lawsuit against the government. Essential to its success, they say, is funding — up to 620 million euros annually, or 52 euros per student, by one estimate, which is about $670 million, or about $56 per student. So far the education ministry has committed no money. “We know the implementation will be difficult,” Ms. Durocher said. “It will be a new feminist battle.”Ségolène Le Stradiccontributed research.

Syria’s Leader Announces New Government After Ousting Dictator,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/middleeast/syria-government-al-shara.html,2025-03-29T22:59:30Z,World,The choice of cabinet officials was seen as a litmus test for whether the rebels who ousted Bashar al-Assad would deliver on a pledge to create a government representative of all Syrians.,Politics and Government; War and Armed Conflicts,"al-Shara, Ahmed (Abu Mohammad al-Jolani) (1982- ); Assad, Bashar al-",Idlib (Syria); Syria; United States,,"Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, announcing the formation of a new government, in Damascus, Syria, on Saturday. Reporting from Damascus, SyriaSyria’s Leader Announces New Government After Ousting DictatorThe choice of cabinet officials was seen as a litmus test for whether the rebels who ousted Bashar al-Assad would deliver on a pledge to create a government representative of all Syrians. Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, announced late Saturday the formation of a caretaker government that will lead the country through a crucial transition as it emerges from more than 50 years of dictatorship under the Assad family’s iron-fisted rule. Mr. al-Shara, who led the coalition of rebel forces that overthrew the Assad regime, appointed a bevy of new ministers, swearing in each before an audience of several hundred dignitaries in a brightly lit hall in the presidential palace on a hill above Damascus. His government included some experienced officials, and one woman — but he appointed close allies to the important ministries of defense, foreign affairs and interior. The rebels whoousted President Bashar al-Assadin December have since been acting as Syria’s de facto authorities. Mr. al-Shara was namedinterim presidentand oversaw a transitional government. Among Mr. al-Shara’s early promises was to form a caretaker government by March that would run the country until elections can be held. He has said that it could takeup to four yearsto hold elections because the country is in disarray. The makeup of the new government announced on Saturday, including key cabinet positions, was widely seen as a litmus test for whether Mr. al-Shara would extend any real power beyond his tight-knit circle of allies and make good on hispledge to create an inclusive governmentthat represents all of Syria’s disparate religious and ethnic groups. The caretaker government will be in power for five years, allowing for a permanent constitution to be adopted and elections to be held, as detailed in aninterim constitutionadopted this month. The announcement on Saturday suggested that Mr. al-Shara was partially bowing to pressure from Syrian society and minority groups, as well as to demands from foreign governments that are considering lifting sanctions. In a clear nod to those critics, Mr. al-Shara replaced his brother as minister of health, and appointed two popular activists to lead ministries. Raed al-Saleh, the head of the White Helmets civil defense organization, was made minister of disasters and emergencies, and Hind Kabawat, who helped organize a recent national dialogue conference, was named minister of social affairs — the lone woman appointee. The chairman of the Syria Civil Defense White Helmets, Raed al-Saleh, during a meeting of the Security Council on Syria at the U.N. headquarters in New York City in December. And in an important gesture to the country’s Kurdish minority, Mr. al-Shara appointed a Kurd as minister of education, a ministry that will be closely watched for how it handles the rewriting of the Assad regime’s education system. Many Arab and Western leaders have said the restoration of full ties with Syria’s new government — including relief from punishing Western sanctions — would happen only if a political process that reflected the country’s ethnic and religious diversity was created. While leading the transitional authority, Mr. al-Shara had placed allies in key government positions, effectively transplanting the provincial administration he once led in the rebel-held city of Idlib. The announcement of the new government comes a monthafter Mr. al-Shara convened a conference for Syrians from across the country to share input and recommendations for an interim administration. Pressure on Mr. al-Shara to make changes to his government grew at home and abroad afterviolence in Syria’s coastal regionthis month. Clashes erupted between remnants of the Assad regime and government security forces. More than 1,000 people were killed, many of them civilians, according to the war monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Mr. al-Shara has also secured important agreements with theKurdish-led militia, which is backed by the United States and controls much of northeastern Syria, and with Druse leaders in the south of the country. The constitutional declaration that was announced this month was drawn up by a committee of experts led by a constitutional law professor. It retains the strong presidential system, granting executive power to the president and the power to appoint judges of the Supreme Court and a third of the members of parliament. But it also set out a separation of branches of government and an independent judiciary that is “subject only to the law,” representing a break from the authoritarian state run by Mr. al-Assad. The constitutional declaration also keeps a stipulation from the old constitution that the president must be a Muslim. It also guarantees freedom of opinion, expression, information, publication and press. Some groups have criticized the temporary constitution for not recognizing Syria’s range of ethnic and religious groups or laying out a system of power sharing. But other analysts and democracy activists have described it as a good interim document that would maintain stability and allow time to debate further changes. Ibrahim Draji, a law professor at Damascus University, said recently in a public discussion in the city that a three-month limit for a state of emergency and other restrictions on the military and security services were new safeguards against a return to dictatorship. But another lawyer at the event, Faeq Huaiji, a co-founder of a Syrian nongovernmental organization, the Equal Citizenship Center, raised several concerns, including that the temporary constitution did not provide for adequate checks on the president.

Taliban Appear to Free American Woman Detained in AfghanistanPresident Trump and a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan shared a video of a woman identified as Faye Hall thanking the president for her release from Afghanistan. An American woman detained in Afghanistan has been released by the Taliban, according to a social media post on Saturday by a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, just days after the United States removed multimillion-dollarbountiesfrom the heads of three senior Taliban officials. Faye Hall, the released American citizen, was pictured sitting on a couch between two men and smiling in a social mediaposton X by Zalmay Khalilzad, the former ambassador. Mr. Khalizad said that Ms. Hall “is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home.”He also shared what he said was a video of Ms. Hall professing support for President Trump and thanking the president for her release. President Trumpreposted the videoon Saturday on his social media site, Truth Social, thanking Ms. Hall and adding that he was “so honored” by her words. Ms. Hall was arrested in early February, British mediareported, along with a British couple and an interpreter. The couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who were both in their seventies, had run educational and training projects in the country for eighteen years, according toBritish media. Ms. Hall was said to be a friend of the couple. The British couple has not been released, according to British media. A daughter of the Reynoldssaidthat Afghan guards had to use force to separate Ms. Hall from Ms. Reynolds when they removed Ms. Hall from detention because the two women had vowed that all four in their group would be released together. The White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, a U.S. hostage envoy, Adam Boehler, made the first known visit by a high-ranking American diplomat to Kabul, the Afghan capital, since the Taliban seized power in 2021. His talks with Taliban representatives led tothe releaseof George Glezmann, an American citizen who had been detained in Afghanistan for more than two years. Days later, the United States lifted multimillion-dollar bounties on three leaders of the Haqqani network, the only wing of the Taliban to be classified by the United States as a foreign terrorist organization. Members of the Haqqani network were behind some of the deadliest attacks during the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, but they have refashioned themselves as a more moderate voice within the Taliban. Many Taliban officials saw Mr. Boehler’s visit and the bounty lifting as a significant victory for Afghanistan’s government, which was almost totally shut out by the Biden administration. The new measures also benefit a Taliban faction that has pushed to curtail extreme and inflexible policies to achieve more global acceptance. In the video posted by Mr. Trump, Ms. Hall also said other women detained in the Afghanistan jail saw Mr. Trump as a “savior,” adding in her address to him, “they’re waiting for you to come and set them free.”Mr. Trump’s post did not include any details about the release.

No Second Lady, No Problem: Greenland’s Dog Sled Race Goes Barking OnGreenland DispatchOne of Greenland’s national pastimes was nearly hijacked this week after the White House said the Second Lady would attend. She didn’t. But a lot of people talked about this as the mushers did their work. At the foot of glistening Mount Nasaasaaq — “the king of the mountains” — in Sisimiut, Greenland, hundreds of spectators bundled in bright jackets, insulated pants and heavy boots lined a snow-packed trail on Saturday waiting for the racers to glide past. The low sun glinted off the ice. The snow squeaked underfoot, fine and dry like sifted flour. Red and white Greenlandic flags popped up everywhere — from poles, tucked into hoods, flapping in mittened hands. For more than three decades, Greenland has held a national dog sledding championship — the Avannaata Qimussersua, which means, in Greenlandic language, “The Great Race of the North.” This year the event brought together more than 25 mushers — including a pretty tough 14-year-old boy — and at least 400 dogs. It’s a tradition deeply rooted in the country’s culture, where dogs are not just animals, but partners in survival. And usually, the race doesn’t attract much international attention. But this year it was swept into a major geopolitical storm when the White House announced that Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance, and one of their sons would attend. With Greenlanders gearing up to protest, Ms. Vance ended up canceling her trip. Protesting against the American pressure taking place against Greenland and Denmark, in front of the American Embassy in Copenhagen on Saturday. Ms. Vance had tried to frame her visit as a gesture of cultural appreciation. The Greenlanders didn’t buy it. President Trump has been fixated on taking over Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of Denmark — and has steadily ratcheted up his talk to “get it, one way or the other,” as he has said. Many Greenlanders (and Danes) saw the visit as a threat. The race organizers quickly issued a pointed statement saying the Vances had not been invited. A spokeswoman for Ms. Vance denied this, saying the second lady had received “multiple invitations.”Ms. Vance, along with her husband and some other officials, did come to Greenland, but ended up spending less than three hours on Friday at the Pituffik Space Base, a remote American missile defense station on Greenland’s northern coast, miles from any town. The race, though, went on, just as planned. For the competitors, it was the culmination of years of daily care, discipline and deep mutual understanding between human and dog. On Saturday afternoon, a voice crackled over the loudspeaker with updates on the competitors’ progress as they cut across the grueling 26-mile course. Children bounced to stay warm. In the distance, sharp barks echoed across the mountain. “We’re not trying to impress anyone,” said Inuna Davidsen, a spectator who was alertly waiting for the sleds to appear. “We just want to stay close to nature and to each other.”People gathering earlier this month in Ilulissat for a city-wide dog sled race to determine which musher would go on to Saturday’s national competition. Like many others here, she saw the event not only as a competition but as a gathering — a space where people from distant settlements meet, celebrate and reconnect in the snow. Sisimiut, which hosted the race this year, is the second largest town in Greenland, with a population of around 5,000. Mikaela Eliassen, an entrepreneur from Sisimiut, was standing by the finish line with her children. She said she was a little disappointed that the Vances didn’t come. “We never get visitors,” she said. “So when we finally heard someone important was coming here, I was excited.”Greenlanders have been working with sled dogs for hundreds of years. They used them to travel to faraway villages and to hunt seals and reindeer. In 1968 when a U.S. nuclear-armed bomber crashed through the ice near what is now the Pituffik base, sled dog teams were called in to help with the cleanup. The dogs’ ability to move across the fragile ice made them essential to the efforts. Today, dogs are still important, assisting Greenlanders in ice fishing, hauling supplies, taking tourists for a ride and even delivering mail. Only one breed is permitted in the Arctic region of Greenland: the purebred Greenlandic sled dog. This breed has evolved over centuries to work in the cold, and, the thinking goes, any mixing could hurt its hardiness. A former musher herself, Ms. Eliassen started driving sleds at age 6. “Dog sledding is not just a sport,” she said. “It teaches responsibility, patience and respect.”People watching the city-wide dog sled race in Ilulissat earlier this month. “They say the musher whose dogs respect him most is the one who wins,” she added. As the first sled crested the final ridge and came into view, the crowd erupted. Henrik Jensen, a 26-year-old musher from Ilulissat in northern Greenland, broke the finish line — his face wind-burned, his dogs frosted with ice and foam but still pulling strong. His supporters surged forward. Some were dressed in matching black jackets with “Team Henrik” emblazoned across their backs. As he sat on his sled, grinning and stunned, a group of fans lifted the wooden sled high into the air — dogs still barking and twisting in their harnesses, energized by the roar of the crowd. “I’ve been preparing for this for years,” he said, his father smiling proudly with a hand on his shoulder. And if any Americans were tuning in, he said, that’s a good thing. “It’s great that you’re following along,” he said. “There should be room for everyone here.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move. U.S.-Iran Talks: Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last,opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitionsand avoid war. Drilling and Mining on Public Land: The Trump administration hasopened thousands of acres of land in Nevada and New Mexicoto oil and gas drilling, geothermal development and hard-rock mining, reversing protections that former President Biden enacted. Harriet Tubman: A National Park Service web page about the Underground Railroad appeared to have beenrestored to prominently show the abolitionist leader, after it had been changed to remove a large photo and quotations from her.

Reporting from Bangkok and New YorkMyanmar Earthquake Toll Surpasses 1,600 Dead Amid Search for SurvivorsAid workers delivered the first shipments of help to Myanmar, but will have to cross a country buckled by the disaster and divided by civil war, arms dealers and drug syndicates. The official death toll of the earthquake that shattered central Myanmar surpassed 1,600 people, the country’s military leaders said on Saturday, as desperate rescue workers raced to find survivors and began grappling with a monumental disaster in a nation already racked by civil war. The powerful earthquake struck on Friday near Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, and volunteer emergency workers there combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques in search of anyone left alive. Stepping over downed power lines and buckled roads, crews toiled as the repressive military authorities kept a watchful eye. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The death toll is expected to rise steeply, although Myanmar’s military junta, which overthrew an elected government in 2021, has sought to restrict what information leaves the country. Preliminary modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths could be more than 10,000. Phyu Lay Khaing is rescued from the collapsed Sky Villa condo before being transported to the hospital in Mandalay on Saturday. The earthquake has raised questions about whether Myanmar’s military rulerscan manage to stay in power, having already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat has left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. Even after the disaster struck, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on Friday evening on a rebel-held village, Naung Lin, in northern Shan State. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. The National Unity Government, the shadow government,saidon Saturday that it would implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations by armed groups over which it has control in quake-hit areas beginning on Sunday. But the shadow authority, made up of opposition politicians and others committed to democratic rule, reserved the right to act defensively. Parts of rebel-held Myanmar were among those hit, and anti-military forces in the Sagaing region were using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, the shadow government said. Anger against the military was rising in the wake of the disaster on Saturday. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer in Mandalay, said that soldiers and police officers had turned up at disaster sites but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”In Photos and VideosBut the junta has also acknowledged the enormous extent of the catastrophe, which caused the collapse of a building 600 miles away in Bangkok and sent shock waves around Southeast Asia. The military government declared a state of emergency in six regions of Myanmar, including rebel-controlled areas where millions of displaced people live with scarce internet. The army’s leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, surveyed disaster sites on Friday and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, about 170 miles south of Mandalay, state media showed. Myanmar’s military chief, Min Aung Hlaing, visiting a hospital in Naypyidaw on Friday. The junta, although isolated and under sanctions from much of the world, also made an extraordinary appeal for help — a call that some began to answer despite the dizzying logisticalobstaclesin getting that aid to survivors. Aid workers will have to traverse collapsed roads and devastated regions, in a countrydivided by full-blown civil war and competing warlords, arms dealers, human traffickers and drug syndicates. There are risks that the military could interfere in the delivery of aid, experts said, and even transferring funds into Myanmar are complicated by the rules involving sanctions and the movement of money. India, which shares a long border with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of aid and more than 100 medical specialists, its foreign minister said, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the junta’s chief, offering help to “a close friend and neighbor.”China, which also borders Myanmar and which has supplied the junta weapons even as evidence grew of its military atrocities, flew dozens of search and rescue workers into the country on Saturday. Beijing also planned to send nearly $14 million in aid, including tents, first aid kits and drinking water, according to Chinese state media. South Korea promised $2 million in aid, shipped through international humanitarian agencies, and Malaysia’s government said it would send two teams of 50 people to support relief work.

Although President Trump said the United States would “be helping,” his administration hasmoved to all but eliminatethe main U.S. agency for distributing aid, and the United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta. Even for countries friendlier to Myanmar’s military rulers, there are major hurdles. The early deliveries of help sent by India and China went to Myanmar’s biggest city, Yangon. They would have to drive hundreds of miles north to reach Mandalay and other areas most affected by the earthquake. In the disaster area, where roads are damaged or destroyed and power is largely gone, people tried to stock up on fuel and food. Dozens of people from other cities in Myanmar also packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Ambulances jammed Mandalay’s streets on Saturday, heading to a hospital two hours away that had more room. Among the mounds of brick, cement and metal where buildings had stood two days earlier, some people began to lose hope. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” said Ko Thien Win, who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay. With the aid of heavy construction equipment, people searching for survivors in the rubble of a building in Mandalay on Saturday. At hospitals, many others were left in a kind of purgatory, dealing with their own injuries and fearing for the fate of their loved ones. Tay Zar Lin had been picking mangoes when the ground started shaking on Friday and he fell, breaking his leg. He reached a hospital, where he could not see a doctor until Saturday morning. He then discovered that his wife was still trapped inside the tailor shop where she worked, he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her,” he said. The uncertainty extended far outside Myanmar, into the diaspora of people who have migrated out of the country in past decades. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands now living in Taiwan, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from friends and family. He knew the wife of one friend had died, apparently in a building collapse, but that sporadic communication had made it hard to learn more. An engineer, he said many buildings in Myanmar, which lies on one of the world’s most active seismic zones, had been built to endure earthquakes. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake,” he said. “But anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much.”And many survivors of the earthquake already know their loved ones’ fates. When the earthquake struck and her apartment in Mandalay began to heave, Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, managed to escape the building with her husband and mother-in-law. But she said her husband ran back inside to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing them. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” she said, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father.”An earthquake survivor in the compound of a hospital in Naypyidaw on Friday.

The gutting of U.S.A.I.D. is likely to hinder recovery efforts in Myanmar.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/29/world/earthquake-myanmar-thailand/the-gutting-of-usaid-is-likely-to-hinder-recovery-efforts-in-myanmar,2025-03-29T18:00:34Z,World,,,,,,"Myanmar’s military government said the death toll had reached 1,644, though that number is expected to rise significantly. In the past, the U.S. Agency for International Development mobilized major relief responses after earthquakes. Not this time. A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”David Piersoncontributed reporting. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids.

Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed.

Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle. A rescue and medical team departing from Kunming, China, to earthquake-stricken Myanmar on Saturday. Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said. Hong Kong will send search-and-rescue personnel to Myanmar on Saturday from various government agencies, the city’s government said in a statement."

Reporting from BangkokIn Bangkok, Grim Vigils as People Seek Word of Relatives at Collapsed BuildingThe collapse of a 30-story building under construction was “not normal,” an engineering expert said. It was one of the biggest projects ever done by a Chinese state-owned company. Aubonrat Setnawet, an electrician’s helper, was working with her husband on the 23rd floor of a new office tower on the northern edge of Bangkok moments before disaster struck. She needed to get some equipment, so she took the construction elevator to the ground floor. Suddenly, she felt the ground sway beneath her and, with two sharp cracking sounds, the unfinished building began to collapse. With her cellphone in hand, she ran to escape the falling debris as a huge dust cloud rose. She tried calling her husband, Nuguy Setnawet, an electrician, but her calls did not go through. Since then, she has remained at the site, watching quietly as rescuers search for survivors. The news has been grim. Eight bodies were recovered from the scene on Friday but only one on Saturday. “I am still here waiting, waiting for a miracle,” Ms. Aubonrat said. Family members of those trapped in the building rubble wait for news in Bangkok’s Chatuchak neighborhood on Saturday in Bangkok. About 80 people believed to have been in the 30-story building at the time of the collapse remain unaccounted for. Rescuers using heavy equipment and canine search teams spotted only the one body during the search on Saturday. The pile of rubble — seven stories high — is so unstable that it took them hours to recover the body. That brought to 10 the number of known fatalities in Bangkok from the quake, including a crane operator who fell to his death from a different building under construction. The epicenter of the quake was more than 600 miles to the north near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, where the devastation was far worse. More than 1,600 were reported dead and the number is expected to rise considerably. At the site of the collapsed Bangkok building, the search continued into the evening under bright lights. Heavy equipment operators moved large chunks of metal from the rubble in the hope of finding survivors. Hundreds of rescuers from the military, the police and volunteer groups helped with the search. Dozens of relatives and friends of the missing workers watched from behind a barrier. Rescue workers using heavy machinery to search for survivors at the collapsed building in Bangkok, on Saturday. In addition to search dogs, rescue teams used heat sensors to try to detect people who were still alive. Periodically, all work stopped so the searchers could listen for the sounds of survivors. But by Saturday evening, they had not heard any cries of help from within the mountain of debris. Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, said heavy equipment that arrived Saturday was being used to clear away large pieces of metal and concrete while workers tried carefully not to destabilize the mountain of debris. “This is to open a path for us to be able to see underneath and check for any signs of life,” he said. “It’s a very difficult task and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well.”Suchatvee Suwansawat, a professor of civil engineering at King Mongkut University and a former president of the Council of Engineers Thailand, said experts must determine whether the collapse was caused by a design flaw or a construction error. An unfinished building should be in no more danger of collapsing during an earthquake than a completed structure, he said. “It has to be 100 percent safe,” he said. “There was something wrong. This is like the building exploded. It’s not normal.”Search-and-rescue dogs joined recovery teams at the site of the collapsed building that was under construction in Bangkok. He said Thailand had never experienced the collapse of a building this size. Previously, he said, two six-story buildings collapsed, one in 2014 and one in 1993. “We really have no experience with this,” he said. “We cannot say much yet because we have to look at the calculations and collect samples and evidence. Everything collapsed at the same time. And from the video, we saw the columns burst.”The building was to be an office tower for Bangkok’s auditor-general. A Chinese state-owned company, the China Railway 10th Engineering Group, was part of a consortium awarded the contract to build the high-rise, according to an article in the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s mouthpiece, that was published in 2021. The consortium also included a Bangkok-based builder, Italian-Thai Development Plc. Neither company could be immediately reached for comment. The project, which broke ground in April 2021, was one of the tallest buildings China Railway 10th Engineering Group had constructed, the People’s Daily said at the time. The company is a subsidiary of a state-owned giant, China Railway Group, which is heavily involved in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to deepen China’s supply chain networks and expand the country’s influence. An injured man is rescued from the debris of the building under construction that collapsed in Bangkok on Friday. Among those waiting at the site for word of their missing relatives was Saifon Thongsuk, 36, whose aunt and uncle and two adult children were all working on the office tower. They had been working at a different construction project on Bangkok’s outskirts but had recently been sent to the site because of an urgent need for workers, she said. “I don’t know how long they had been working here,” she said. “I only know they were working on the top floor.”Naruemol Thonglek, 44, came to the site seeking word of six people including her husband, his son and four co-workers. Ms. Naruemol had been working at the site, too, until recently, but quit because her husband worried that it was leaving her too exhausted. “I rushed here as soon as I heard about the earthquake,” she said. “I tried to get hold of him. Messages were not delivered. Calls were not connected. I cannot contact any of them.”She continued, “I guess he is in the middle of that pile of rubble. Maybe there’s some space for air, I don’t know. I can only hope for miracles.”Thurian Pheungrod, 47, also hurried to the site on Friday after learning that his brother and sister-in-law were buried in the collapsed building. They had been working at the site for several months. “At first, I still believed there could be a miracle,” he said. “I still had hope. But I don’t hope for miracles anymore.”Rescue workers sought to mitigate dust at the site of the building collapse in Bangkok’s Chatuchak neighborhood, on Saturday.

Myanmar’s junta resumed attacks on rebel-held areas soon after the devastating earthquake.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/29/world/earthquake-myanmar-thailand/myanmars-junta-resumed-attacks-on-rebel-held-areas-soon-after-the-devastating-earthquake,2025-03-29T16:21:06Z,World,,,,,,"Myanmar’s military government said the death toll had reached 1,644, though that number is expected to rise significantly. Myanmar’s military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

In the past, the U.S. Agency for International Development mobilized major relief responses after earthquakes. Not this time. A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”David PiersonRescuers searching for survivors trapped in a condominium building in Mandalay, Myanmar. Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed.

Volunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle. A rescue and medical team departing from Kunming, China, to earthquake-stricken Myanmar on Saturday. Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said. Hong Kong will send search-and-rescue personnel to Myanmar on Saturday from various government agencies, the city’s government said in a statement."

Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed. Jenny Gross,David PiersonandMujib Mashalcontributed reporting. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

In the past, the U.S. Agency for International Development mobilized major relief responses after earthquakes. Not this time. A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”Myanmar’s military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids.

Volunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle. A rescue and medical team departing from Kunming, China, to earthquake-stricken Myanmar on Saturday. Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said. Hong Kong will send search-and-rescue personnel to Myanmar on Saturday from various government agencies, the city’s government said in a statement."

The Ministry of Defense said it was investigating.",Defense and Military Forces; Classified Information and State Secrets,,Great Britain; Newcastle-on-Tyne (England),,"Catterick Garrison is a major military base in North Yorkshire, England. Its name appeared on documents found scattered in Newcastle, about 60 miles away. Found: British Military Documents, Scattered on the StreetA man in Northern England said he had stumbled upon hundreds of documents, including threat assessments, armory codes and detailed base patrols. The Ministry of Defense said it was investigating. As he was rushing to attend a soccer match in Newcastle, England, Michael Gibbard stepped on a pile of sensitive military documents. At first, he thought the papers scattered along a street near the stadium were trash, dumped there from a nearby office building. But when he bent down and examined them closely, he was stunned by what he saw. Names and ranks of soldiers. Detailed base patrols. Drug test results. Codes to weapon armories. “I thought, bloody hell, this shouldn’t be here,” said Mr. Gibbard, a 41-year-old owner of a delivery service. Mr. Gibbard's accidental discovery this month of what appeared to be hundreds of military documents on an industrial street in Northern England has shocked a country known for zealously protecting state secrets. It also comes as the United States, Britain’s close military ally, has been facing its own crisis over the handling of sensitive national security information, after battle plans in Yemen werediscussed in a group chatthat included a journalist. But while the United States’ security breach came about because of a technological blunder on the encrypted app Signal, the apparent error in the United Kingdom was much more analog. “I thought a lot of this would be online, and there would be military software you’d need to access it,” Mr. Gibbard said. “But here it was, printed off for all the world to see. It was very old-school.”As he picked documents off the street and out of the gutter, he became aware of just how much material, from threat assessments to mundane requests for leave, he had stumbled upon. “It was like a library of information,” he said. A Ministry of Defense spokesperson said that the incident was being investigated and that “no sensitive operational defense information is contained within the documents.”The papers appeared to originate from a black trash bag slumped against a nearby brick wall. As Mr. Gibbard dug through the bag, he noticed a name repeated on the top of some documents: Catterick Garrison. Mr. Gibbard, who said he had no interest in the military, didn’t know what that was, so he typed the term into Google. The garrison, he discovered, is a major military base in North Yorkshire, about 50 miles south of Newcastle. It’s the largest garrison in the British Army, and home tomore than 13,000 people. “I was like, How on earth has this bag traveled like 50 minutes away?” Mr. Gibbard said. More surprising, he added, was that the documents had been printed at all. “You put your safety in the hands of the military and the government to make sure that this information is kept away from us, so it doesn’t potentially get in the wrong hands,” he said. “And they’re still printing loads and loads of paperwork out, explaining everything.”After spending a few minutes reading through lists of weapons and phone numbers of high-ranking officers, Mr. Gibbard began to feel uneasy about the position he had found himself in. He decided to take a photograph — but only one, he said, because he didn’t know if it was legal to have images of the documents. “I can’t imagine the army would let me into the base and start taking photos of all their paperwork, would they?” he said. “So this felt no different.”After he snapped an image, he called the police. When no one arrived after about 15 minutes — and with the kickoff to the soccer match moments away — he collected what he judged to be the most sensitive documents and took them to the police at the soccer arena. They found his tale highly suspicious. “Their reaction was like, ‘Riiiiiight,’” he said. “I said, ‘Wait a minute, I’ve done nothing wrong here, I’m just passing on the information.’”A Northumbria Police spokesperson confirmed that the department had received a report on March 16 that potentially confidential documents had been found near the center of Newcastle, and said that they had been given to the Ministry of Defense. When Mr. Gibbard left the soccer match about four hours later, he said, many of the papers were gone, but some remained scattered in the area. “The timing is quite ironic,” Mr. Gibbard said, pointing to the leaked Signal conversation in the United States. “I mean, you’ve got these two powerhouses, the U.K. and America,” who, he said, love to “brag about how great they are at everything.”If that’s true, he added, then “we’re a country that should know how to handle our military paperwork better — same with America.”Susan C.

Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, Desperate Rescue Efforts and Sinking HopesVolunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. In Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”The earthquake caused the collapse of Mandalay’s Maha Myat Muni Pagoda, also known as the Mahamuni Buddha Temple. On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”Searching through debris in Mandalay on Saturday. He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. Rescue workers in Mandalay on Saturday. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape.

A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears.

The powerful earthquake that shook Myanmar on Friday took a considerable toll on historic and religious sites across the country, toppling pagodas, collapsing sections of Buddhist monasteries and reducing centuries-old monuments to rubble, according to photographs and videos shared by witnesses and verified by The New York Times. In its latest count on Saturday morning,Myanmar’s government saidthat over 3,000 buildings had been damaged, including about 150 mosques and pagodas. Southwest of Mandalay, the 200-year-old Me Nu Brick Monastery appeared to belargely destroyed. Tiers of the building’sdistinctive balconieshad collapsed around the bulky interior walls. Southeast of Mandalay, a video showed the ornate golden spire of the Shwe Sar Yan Pagoda toppling over, to the screams of onlookers. In Mandalay city, a large pagoda that stood on the palace walls was lefttilted at a sharp angle; elsewhere, asection of the wallscrumbled. To the west of the city, a video showed Buddhist monks gathered around the ruins of adecorative clock towerthat had served as a centerpiece of the New Masoeyein Monastery. Seconds later, video showed their five-story monastery building collapsing before them. Dozens of monks who lived at the monastery slept out on mats in nearby streets on Friday night. One of them, Moe Nat Ashin,photographedthe scene. Photos shared by theBurma Human Rights Networkshowed fallen minarets and domes of mosques in several parts of the country. The online news outlet Mizzima, citing local officials and residents, reported that 490 people werekilled in mosque collapseson Friday. In Pindaya, 70 miles from the epicenter, Buddhist monuments known as stupas that adorned a large monastery were toppled, and cracks split the foundations of others that survived. All around the stupas, the remains of golden spires and the red bricks common to the region littered the ground. In one witness video, onlookers wailed as the top of the monastery’s largest stupas crumbled in an aftershock. “Pindaya felt some earthquakes before but not so strong like today’s,” said Tun Tun Aye, the administrator of a Facebook page for the monastery. He said that the stupas were believed to be more than a century old, and that he did not know how the monastery would be restored. In Nepal in 2015,billions of dollars were pledgedtoward reconstruction after two earthquakes devastated the country. Initiallyhampered by bureaucracy, the restoration led to aresurgence in traditional craftsmanshipin the country. But in Myanmar, which isruled by a military juntathat has terrorized civilian areas as it battles a rebel movement, establishing a unified and internationally supported reconstruction effort is likely to be more challenging.

Trump and Tariffs Enter the Scene Only Days Into Canada’s Election CampaignWithout advance notice to Canada, the U.S. president put the auto industry into turmoil with a 25 percent tariff. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s election campaign had brought him to the bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, over which $300 million worth of auto parts cross daily. He unveiled a series of promises of programs for workers and auto-related industries that would be rolled out if President Trump imposed tariffs on products from the Canadian auto industry. Among them was a proposed fund of 2 billion Canadian dollars to reshape the industry for a future without the U.S. market. The stakes are high. Cars and auto parts are the country’s second-biggest export by value and an employer, directly and indirectly, of about 500,000 people, accounting for 10 percent of manufacturing gross domestic product. But what Mr. Carney, nor anyone else in the Canadian government, knew at that time was that a few hours later the program would no longer be something for an emergency situation. Mr. Trump, without first informing Canada, announced that he was imposing 25 percent tariffs effective April 2 on all imports of cars and auto parts, with no exemption for Canada.

How to deal with Mr. Trump and his trade agenda were, of course, at the top of the list of issues when the election campaign began on Sunday. Canada’s Leader Calls Snap Federal Elections Amid Trump ThreatsBut few expected that the president’s actions would intrude on the first week of campaigning. Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, offered no specific plan for the auto industry to deal with tariffs. Here’s how the three leading national parties are promising to deal with the future of the auto industry: Liberals: Mr. Carney said his fund would “build an all-in-Canada auto manufacturing network.” He added: “On average, auto parts cross the border six times before final assembly. In a trade war, that’s a huge vulnerability.”Conservatives: Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, did not directly offer a plan for the auto sector but renewed his call for an end to the carbon tax on industries as well as expansion of Canada’s energy and natural resource sectors to revitalize the economy. “We have to become more self-reliant and have new and different markets,” he said this week. New Democrats: Jagmeet Singh, the party’s leader, appeared in Windsor, his hometown, the day after Mr. Carney. He said that if auto companies based in the United States wanted to continue selling in Canada, he would require them to make vehicles in Canada or buy Canadian parts. He also said that he would use past government subsidies to block the removal of any machinery or tooling to the United States. “Those machines, those tools, that equipment — Canadians paid for them,” he said. “They belong to us.”For an general assessment of the industry’s future, I spoke with Greig Mordue, the former general manager of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. Mr. Mordue is now a professor of engineering at McMaster University in Hamilton, and his doctoral thesis was partly a history of automaking in Canada. He said that the idea of an all-Canadian car industry had popped up every now and then since a government inquiry in 1960 promoted something it suggested be called the Beaver. It doesn’t seem that any party is going that far, which may be just as well. Mr. Mordue said that “there’s really not enough volume to make a viable, profitable, sustainable Canadian automotive company.”But he said that if Mr. Trump did enact his auto tariffs next week and if they were sustained, the result might be the opposite of what Mr. Carney hopes for the parts makers. “The parts industry in Canada will be devastated, and it will be devastated quite rapidly,” he said. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democrats, said he would block the removal of carmaking machinery to the United States. Parts makers face two problems. The profit margin on parts is a fraction of the 25 percent tariff rate, so their operations will become deeply financially unsustainable. At the same time, Mr. Mordue doesn’t expect that the automakers will immediately walk away from their multibillion-dollar assembly plants and their skilled and trained employees. Instead, he said, they are likely to try to buy as many parts as possible from the United States as a tariff solution. The Trump administration has indicated that the tariffs on cars assembled outside the United States will be lowered based on their American content. But even if assembly plants stay open for now, Mr. Mordue sees a dim future for the industry should American tariffs be put in place and persist. “If this goes through, nothing good happens for the Canadian automotive industry,” he said. “They will scramble, and they will find workarounds. But those workarounds will ultimately only delay the eventual withering of automotive manufacturing.”As the week ended, Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump had their first telephone conversation. The president dropped his rhetoric about making Canada the 51st state, and the two leaders described their talk in positive tones. But Mr. Trump later said that his tariffs against Canada were “absolutely” coming on April 2.

Turkey’s Opposition Is Energized: ‘The Fire Is Already Lit’,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/middleeast/turkey-opposition.html,2025-03-29T09:03:06Z,World,Supporters of the political opposition are finding ways to fight back after the government jailed the top political rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.,"Politics and Government; Demonstrations, Protests and Riots; Political Prisoners; Elections","Erdogan, Recep Tayyip; Imamoglu, Ekrem",Turkey; Istanbul (Turkey),,"Police officers using pepper spray on demonstrators protesting the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, on Monday. Reporting from IstanbulTurkey’s Opposition Is Energized: ‘The Fire Is Already Lit’Supporters of the political opposition are finding ways to fight back after the government jailed the top political rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey’s largest opposition party is organizing rallies, urging boycotts of pro-government businesses and standing by its presidential candidate — even if he will have to campaign from jail. At universities, students have formed councils to direct protests and spread the word, sharing tips for dealing with the riot police and tear gas. Their efforts — part of the largest wave of political protest in Turkey in more than a decade — were catalyzed by the government’s March 19arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s top political rival. They have been met with equally vast measures by Mr. Erdogan’s government to quash them. But instead of cowing opposition supporters, the crackdown seems to be energizing them. “Everybody in the forums and meetings says this is not only about Imamoglu,” said Irem Tacyildiz, 24, an economics student at Middle East Technical University in the capital, Ankara, who has participated in protests. “The fire is already lit.”But it remains unclear to what extent the nascent protest movement can sustain its momentum and succeed in persuading or forcing the government to change course. The government removed Mr. Imamoglufrom his post and jailed him last Sundaypending trial on corruption charges. That same day, his political party picked him as its candidate in the next presidential election. His university also annulled his diploma, citing improper procedures more than three decades ago, which effectively blocked him from the presidential race because candidates must have completed higher education. Mr. Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, last year. Mr. Imamoglu has denied the charges and vowed to fight them in court. The opposition has called his arrest a “coup” aimed at blocking a challenge to Mr. Erdogan. Turkey is officially a democratic republic, but foreign officials, experts and many Turks say that Mr. Erdogan has in recent years pushed the country toward autocracy and is now seeking to furtherconsolidate his power. That means that Turks seeking to resist the government must reckon with Mr. Erdogan’s control of the security forces and influence over the news media and courts, analysts say. “The authoritarian side is getting stronger and with each step, the areas for struggle where the opposition can express its positions and talk about injustices are becoming narrower,” said Seren Selvin Korkmaz, co-director ofIstanPol, an Istanbul-based think tank. “So the opposition always needs to find creative solutions to express their positions to the people.”The news of Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest led to large nightly protests in front of Istanbul’s City Hall and in other Turkish cities. The police cleared many of them by force. Leading the opposition is the Republican People’s Party, or C.H.P., to which Mr. Imamoglu belongs. The party of Turkey’s revered founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, it stands for staunchly secular government and draws most its support from the larger, coastal cities. Its most public face has been its leader, Ozgur Ozel, a pharmacist and lawmaker known for his altercations with members of Mr. Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party in Parliament. After Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest, he took up residence in a room in City Hall with a small bed to coordinate the party’s response, delivering fiery nightly speeches to the protesters. He called for boycotting companies linked to pro-government news channels that did not air footage of the demonstrations. “A boycott is coming for whoever ignores this square,” he yelled during an address last Sunday, his voice hoarse. “We will use the power of our consumption.”People protesting Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest in Istanbul. In an interview on Friday, Gokhan Gunaydin, a senior official with the party, said it would push for early presidential elections while trying to channel what he called a broader disgruntlement with the “blatant anti-democratic push” by the government. The party planned to stick with Mr. Imamoglu, he said, even if that meant prison became his “presidential campaign office.”The party would fight the charges against the mayor, his aides and other party officials and contest the cancellation of his diploma, he said. It would push ahead with the boycott and organize regular rallies to support Mr. Imamoglu around Istanbul and elsewhere in the country. Many protesters are university students expressing anger at how Mr. Erdogan has run the country and worried about restrictions on civil rights. At first, the students at her university had been surprised by the harsh police response, said Ms. Tacyildiz, the economics student. So they organized precautions: gas masks, asthma medications and antacids, which can counter the effects of tear gas. A university search and rescue club volunteered to help if protesters got injured. Many of her friends have been arrested and police were patrolling her campus in plain clothes and using drones to track protests, she said. Some of the protesters wore masks to prevent the police from identifying them. The students distrust the courts and feel anxious about where the country is headed, she said. A protester wearing a gas mask during clashes last Sunday. The government has issued blanket bans on public demonstrations and closed transit hubs, and riot police have dispersed protesters with water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray. More than 1,800 people have been arrested and about 260 jailed pending trial, according to the Interior Ministry. Pro-government news outlets, many owned by allies of Mr. Erdogan, have avoided live broadcasts of the protests while dedicating substantial airtime to the accusations against Mr. Imamoglu. On Thursday, a parliamentary committee that regulates the news media suspended an opposition broadcaster, SZC TV, for 10 days after accusing it of “inciting the public to hatred and hostility,” according to a statement on its website. Three other pro-opposition channels were also fined for showing Mr. Ozel, the opposition party leader, criticizing the state prosecutor who ordered the mayor’s arrest, an opposition member of the committee wrote on social media. Mr. Erdogan has dismissed the protesters as violent vandals and accused the opposition of fueling havoc in the streets to avoid confronting the corruption allegations against its members. On Thursday, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc insisted to reporters that the courts were independent and criticized attempts to dismiss the investigation of Mr. Imamoglu as political. “This investigation is conducted entirely by independent judicial bodies, and when the investigative authorities become aware of these allegations, it would be unthinkable of them not to open an investigation,” he said. He denied any relation between Mr. Imamoglu’s nomination to run for president and his detention. “This is not related to his candidacy process or other developments,” he said. Turkey’s next election is scheduled for 2028, but many Turks expect Parliament to call for early elections in which Mr. Erdogan, 71, could potentially run against Mr. Imamoglu, 54. Osman Sert, the director ofPanoramaTR, a research institute in Ankara, said Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest had a “rallying around the flag effect” that helped unite the opposition. Still, he said, it faced a government with great power that would be a challenge to confront. “Turkey is still not in a position where democracy is already on hold and totally canceled. But these are of course the most difficult days for democracy,” he said. “These are the rules of the game and you can’t get out of it.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

A Question in Quake-Wracked Myanmar: Does This Augur the End of the Junta?,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/asia/myanmar-quake-junta.html,2025-03-29T08:31:06Z,World,"In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change.","Myanmar Earthquake (March 28, 2025); Deaths (Fatalities); War and Armed Conflicts; Earthquakes; Politics and Government; Civilian Casualties",Min Aung Hlaing,Mandalay (Myanmar); Myanmar; Naypyidaw (Myanmar); Shan State (Myanmar); Yangon (Myanmar),,"Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago, at a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Friday. A Question in Quake-Wracked Myanmar: Does This Augur the End of the Junta? In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. Destruction in Mandalay, Myanmar, on Saturday. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)Damaged pagodas in Naypyitaw, Myanmar after Friday’s earthquake. One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habits. Resistance soldiers in southern Karenni State, in Myanmar, in 2024. The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general."

Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle."

A rescue and medical team departing from Kunming, China, to earthquake-stricken Myanmar on Saturday. Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

In the past, the U.S. Agency for International Development mobilized major relief responses after earthquakes. Not this time. A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”David PiersonMyanmar’s military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids. Rescuers searching for survivors trapped in a condominium building in Mandalay, Myanmar. Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed.

Rescue workers in Mandalay on Saturday. A long line of motorbikes outside of a gas station. Volunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said. Hong Kong will send search-and-rescue personnel to Myanmar on Saturday from various government agencies, the city’s government said in a statement."
Here are the latest developments.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/29/world/earthquake-myanmar-thailand/here-is-the-latest,2025-03-29T04:12:44Z,World,,,,,,"Myanmar’s military government said the death toll had reached 1,644, though that number is expected to rise significantly. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

In the past, the U.S. Agency for International Development mobilized major relief responses after earthquakes. Not this time. A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”David PiersonMyanmar’s military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids. Rescuers searching for survivors trapped in a condominium building in Mandalay, Myanmar. Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed.

Rescue workers in Mandalay on Saturday. A long line of motorbikes outside of a gas station. Volunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle.

Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said. Hong Kong will send search-and-rescue personnel to Myanmar on Saturday from various government agencies, the city’s government said in a statement."
Hold the Chianti: Tariff Threat Leaves Italian Bottles Grounded,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/europe/italy-wine-trump-tariff-threat.html,2025-03-29T04:01:10Z,World,"For now, President Trump’s 200 percent tariff on wine remains just a threat.

In Tuscany, Italy’s second-largest wine-exporting region, thousands of bottles meant for American tables are stranded in chilly cellars and storage rooms. Reporting from Montalcino and Montepulciano, ItalyHold the Chianti: Tariff Threat Leaves Italian Bottles GroundedFor now, President Trump’s 200 percent tariff on wine remains just a threat. But jittery American wine importers have already hit pause on orders from Tuscany. All it took was an all-caps social media threat by President Trump to impose a 200 percent tariff on European wine for the shipments of many Brunellos, Chiantis and Proseccos to come to a shuddering halt. In Tuscany, Italy’s most famous wine-exporting region, thousands of bottles meant for American tables are stranded in the wineries’ chilly cellars or in storage rooms in Livorno, the port city from which they were to depart. “Everything is stopped,” said Tiziana Mazzetti, the sales and marketing manager of the Old Cellar, a winery in the Tuscan town of Montepulciano, as she stood among boxes of wine bottles that were supposed to leave this month for the United States. “The damage is already here.”So far, Mr. Trump’s threat remains just that. But it has been enough for jittery American importers to pause orders rather than potentially pay tariffs that could make the wine unaffordable for some and just not worth it for others. If the tariffs were to be imposed — and passed on to consumers in full — a $20 bottle would suddenly cost $60. “Everything is stopped,” said Tiziana Mazzetti, the sales and marketing manager of the Old Cellar, a winery in the Tuscan town of Montepulciano. Together with France and Spain, Italy is among the most exposed in Europe to American tariffs on wine, and many say a 200 percent tariff would be devastating. For nearly 15 years, the United States has been Italy’s biggest export market for wines. About a quarter of Italy’s wine exports, or about $2 billion worth, get shipped to America each year. Across Tuscany’s rolling hills, with its olive groves and cypress-lined country roads, that relationship feels especially tight. For decades, wine importers speaking Tuscan-inflected, American-accented Italian have flocked to Tuscany, taking back bottles of its famous Chiantis and Brunellos to the tables of American homes and restaurants. American wine lovers come in droves to the region — second only to Veneto for its wine exports — and Tuscan wine shops post signs that read, “USA+Europe free shipping.”Perhaps not for much longer. Tourists at a wine shop in Montepulciano. For decades, wine importers have flocked to Tuscany, taking back bottles of its famous Chiantis and Brunellos to the tables of American homes and restaurants. Giancarlo Pacenti, whose winery is on the slopes of the medieval hilltop town of Montalcino, sat beside prizes he received from American wine magazines for his Brunellos as he described his fears for the future. Mr. Pacenti, who inherited his father’s winery, visits the United States several times a year. He has exported his wine — made from Sangiovese grapes and aged in barrels of French oak — across the Atlantic since the mid-1990s. Strong American demand helped grow his business, he said, and he now sells nearly 40 percent of his wine to importers in the United States. But now, the importers are telling him to pause further shipments. “A pillar is crumbling,” he said. “We would have never expected that we would find a closed door where we always had absolute freedom.”Some producers said the threat of tariffs added to other recent woes, includingthe rise of nonalcoholic wines, beers and spirits. “We would have never expected that we would find a closed door where we always had absolute freedom,” said Giancarlo Pacenti, the owner of the Siro Pacenti winery. On the other side of the ocean, importers said the uncertainty caused by the escalating global trade war was forcing them to take a break as shipments, which travel by sea, could arrive at customs after tariffs go into effect. “The tariffs could be 200 percent,” said Brian Larky, an American importer of Mr. Pacenti’s wines, who is based in Napa Valley, in California. “That’s enough to stop you in your tracks.”Importers, who are responsible for paying the tariffs, could pass the cost to customers, but it would no doubt reduce sales. They could also absorb the cost of the tariffs, erasing their profits, or request that producers bear some of the burden, hitting their earnings. But with a 200 percent tariff, “we’d all end up jobless,” said Ms. Mazzetti, from the Montepulciano winery. Mr. Trumpannounced his intention of imposing the crushing tariffson European wine and champagne on Truth Social on March 13. It was part of a tit-for-tat trade fight with the European Union that started with a batch of Trump-imposed tariffs. The bloc responded with what Mr. Trump called a “nasty” 50 percent tariff on American whiskey, which led him to issue his threat against “all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES” if the whiskey tariff were not removed. The European Union has sincesaid it would delay that tariffto give officials more time to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Mr. Trump said that the tariffs on European alcoholic products “will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” But it might not be that simple. For most U.S. wine producers,sales rely on small businesses— distributors, retailers and restaurateurs — that also depend partly on the sales of European wines. The warehouse of the Siro Pacenti winery, where orders destined for the United States are being held because of fears of tariffs threatened by President Trump. “Those Italian wines are needed in Italian restaurants,” said Mr. Larky, who imports nearly five million bottles of Italian wine into the United States every year. “People are not going to substitute wines from la Loire, from Chablis, or from Tuscany — a Brunello or Barolo — with some wine from Chile.”As they strolled this past week around Montalcino, which overlooks a valley of vineyards, some American tourists agreed. “It would be a huge loss,” said Dave Whitmer, 74, a retired physician from Sonoma, in California, who says he prefers Italian and French wines to the homegrown variety. “I grew up drinking American wine,” he said. “But I grew up.”Other American tourists said they had ordered hundreds of bottles of wine from local wineries during their vacation to stock up before any tariffs came into effect. “I told them to ship them right away,” said Jennifer Mangusson, 48, from Idaho. “It would be a huge loss,” said Dave Whitmer, right, a retired physician from Sonoma, in California. While some producers had initially rushed to stack American warehouses with bottles before the tariffs came into effect, they say that window has mostly closed. “Our biggest clients have already sent letters to Italian producers telling them to hold off,” said Lamberto Frescobaldi, the president of the Italian Wine Union, the country’s largest winemakers’ association. “With this uncertainty, we can’t afford to bottle and ship.”The Bourgogne Wine Board, a trade association that promotes Burgundy wines in France, and the Spanish wine association also said they were seeing a similar trend, with importers putting some shipments on hold. Ben Grossberg, who imports Portuguese wine into the United States, said that he canceled his last container 15 minutes before it departed from the warehouse in Portugal. “The risk of putting wine on the water is too great,” he said. Some importers with a higher tolerance for risk have still been placing orders, but Mr. Frescobaldi said that if the tariffs were to actually come into effect, “it would be a deadly blow” for the industry. “The American market,” he said, “is irreplaceable.”Some American tourists said they had ordered hundreds of bottles of wine from local wineries during their vacation to stock up before any tariffs came into effect. Tuscans still expressed hope that the European Union could somehow persuade Mr. Trump to back off. But even if the trade battle cools, many in Tuscany and elsewhere fear that at least part of the losses inflicted amid the uncertainty cannot be undone. Laura Mayr, the general manager of the Ruggeri winery, which makes Prosecco in northern Italy, said that at this time of the year, she and her staff were usually organizing promotional activities and tastings for American importers. But they had stopped. “The damage is already done,” Ms. Mayr said. “We have lost time at a critical moment.”Roser Toll Pifarrécontributed reporting from Barcelona.

Reporting from London‘A Great Emboldening’: Trump Inspires Wannabe Authoritarians Everywherenews analysisPresident Trump has turned a central precept of American diplomacy on its head, embracing fellow leaders who abandon democratic principles. When President Joseph R. Biden Jr. convened democracy summits at the White House in 2021 and 2023, he pointedly disinvited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a man he had once described an “autocrat” who deserved to be driven from office by voters. On Tuesday, President Trump offered a much rosier assessment of the Turkish president, even asprotesters filled the streetsfollowing the arrest of the mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan’s chief political rival. “A good leader,” the president said of Mr. Erdogan during a meeting of his ambassadors at the White House. He made no mention of the arrest or the protests. Since taking office 66 days ago, Mr. Trump has turned a central precept of American diplomacy on its head. He is embracing — rather than denouncing — fellow leaders who abandon democratic principles. The longstanding bipartisan effort to bolster democratic institutions around the globe has been replaced by a president who praises leaders who move toward autocracy. And Mr. Trump’s own actions — taking revenge against his political rivals, attacking law firms, journalists and universities, and questioning the authority of the judiciary — are offering new models for democratically elected leaders in countries like Serbia and Israel who have already shown their willingness to push the boundaries of their own institutions. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is “a good leader,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday at a meeting of U.S. ambassadors at the White House. “There’s a great emboldening,” said Rosa Balfour, the Europe director for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “What Trump says reverberates strongly here. But also what the United States does not do. It does not punish or condemn any attempt to undermine rule of law or democracy. There are no repercussions.”Jane Harman, a former member of Congress and former president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, noted that Mr. Erdogan and other leaders around the world had been “drifting away” from democratic principles for years. In 2016, a faction in Mr. Erdogan’s government attempted a coup to overthrow him. Since then, he has tightened control of the presidency by attacking the media, political opponents, the courts and other institutions. “This has become a very different world, but I don’t think Trump started it, and I don’t think Trump is going to end it either,” Ms. Harman said. And she noted that in at least a few places, Mr. Trump’s return to power had prompted some voters to question the authoritarian leanings of candidates and parties. “Think Germany,” she said, referring to recent elections in the country. “The far right has risen in popularity, but it didn’t win. And the backlash to Trump might have been part of the momentum that held it back.”President Erdogan, center, and his wife in Ankara, Turkey, last month. Mr. Trump is not the first president to tolerate less-than-democratic actions from allies when they deemed it necessary. Mr. Biden offered a fist-bump to Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, even as heblamed himfor the murder of the columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr. Biden alsoworked withPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India, who has increasingly cracked down on dissent in his country, and — at times — with Mr. Erdogan. But Mr. Trump’s election has coincided with actions by elected leaders that appear to depart from the kind of democratic principles that America stood for. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu no longer needs to contend with Mr. Biden’s opposition to a long-planned overhaul of the courts, which many Israelis view as an attempt to control andpoliticize the judiciary. In 2023, Mr. Biden told reporters that Mr. Netanyahu “cannot continue down this road” of judicial changes. Now, with Mr. Trump in office, the Israeli leader faces no such pressure. This month, hefired the chiefof the country’s domestic intelligence agency, a move seen as undermining its independence. Later, the cabinet approved avote of no confidencein the country’s attorney general, prompting fresh accusations that Mr. Netanyahu is curbing the independence of the justice system, purging officials he considers disloyal. On Thursday, Mr. Netanyahu’s allies in Parliament voted to give themselves more power over the selection of Israel’s judges. The vote came after the prime minister gave a speech echoing Mr. Trump and saying that the action meant that “the deep state is in danger.”“The U.S. is not going to put any pressure whatsoever on Netanyahu to respect the democratic institutions of his own country,” Ms. Balfour said. “Netanyahu feels that he has impunity in that respect.”In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer subject to the Biden administration’s opposition to an overhaul of the courts that many in his country view as an attempt to undermine the judicial system. In Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic has spent years attacking the media and other political opponents. Last month — as Mr. Trump dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development — Mr. Vucic sent the police to raid organizations in his country, some of which had received money from the now largely shuttered American agency. Authorities in Mr. Vucic’s governmentcited Mr. Trump’s actionsin the United States as justification for moving against the organizations, including theCentre for Research, Transparency and AccountabilityandCivic Initiatives. They quoted Elon Musk, the multibillionaire who is running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, who claimed, without evidence, that USAID was a “criminal organization.”Two weeks after the raids in Serbia, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, traveled to Belgrade, the country’s capital, to interview Mr. Vucic forhis podcast. In the interview, Mr. Vucic complained that he, like the American president, is opposed by “an entire liberal establishment from Washington and New York and L.A. going against you.” He said the raids of the nongovernmental organizations were designed to root out corruption and financial mismanagement. Mr. Trump Jr. fawned over Mr. Vucic, describing what he called “an embrace of common sense, an embrace of law and order, of a shared national sense of identity.” He criticized protesters angry about Mr. Vucic’s recent actions.

That same propaganda machine.”The president’s son is not the only one echoing his father’s language. Last week, after Mr. Erdogan’s government jailed the mayor of Istanbul, one of Mr. Trump’s senior diplomatic envoys spoke positively about Turkey’s leader during an interview with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “Really transformational,” Steve Witkoff said of a recent telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan. “There’s just a lot of good, positive news coming out of Turkey right now as a result of that conversation.”Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University, said Mr. Trump’s words and actions — and those of his surrogates — are being watched by other leaders. She said the president’s lack of condemnation of Mr. Erdogan following the arrest of the Istanbul mayor would have been noted by authoritarian-leaning presidents and prime ministers. “The moves of Trump in this same direction,” she said, “embolden foreign leaders who know the U.S. is now an autocratic ally and there will be no consequences for repressive behavior.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Model Who Says She Dated Andrew Tate Accuses Him of Sexual Assault in LawsuitBrianna Stern of Los Angeles accused Andrew Tate of beating and choking her while they were in a relationship, according to a complaint. Mr. Tate, through his lawyers, denied her allegations. A Los Angeles woman is suing Andrew Tate, the online influencer known for promoting misogynistic views, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her while they were in a relationship. The civil complaint, filed on Thursday in Superior Court in Los Angeles County by Brianna Stern, a model, claimed that Mr. Tate choked, beat and verbally degraded her while they were in a relationship that began last July and included a hotel stay in California this month. It is the latest legal accusation against Mr. Tate, who is also being investigated by the authorities in Britain and Romania on allegations of human trafficking, money laundering and sex crimes. Mr. Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, spent about two years in and out of house arrest in Romania amid an investigation by the authorities there and were allowed to leave the country in February. Mr. Tate denied Ms. Stern’s allegations through his representatives. “This is a blatant cash grab — a desperate attempt by a sad individual to exploit Andrew’s success and reputation for personal gain,” his U.S. legal team said in a statement. “Ms. Stern has chosen to air her false claims in the press, revealing her true motives: money and attention, not justice.”In the 30-page lawsuit, Ms. Stern accused Andrew Tate of threatening her with violence and psychologically controlling her during their relationship. She asked the court for a restraining order, saying that Mr. Tate had forced her to install an app on her phone so that he could track her, and give him the passwords to her social media accounts. Tony Buzbee, a lawyer for Ms. Stern, said in an email on Friday that his client was courageous for shedding light on the alleged abuse. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Stern and Mr. Tate met in July 2024. Ms. Stern, a model and influencer with her own cryptocurrency coin, was searching for advice, the lawsuit said, and Mr. Tate was looking for models to join him in Romania to help promote his crypto meme coin. She went to Romania and they began a relationship, discussing plans to live together in the United States, the lawsuit said. At times, Mr. Tate was loving and kind, the lawsuit said, but he also berated her and hit her. To exert his control over her, the lawsuit said, he asked Ms. Stern to get a tattoo with the words “Property of Tate,” which the lawsuit said he had required of several former girlfriends. Ms. Stern said in the suit that Mr. Tate assaulted her during a stay at The Beverly Hills Hotel on March 10. Mr. Tate choked and beat Ms. Stern until she nearly lost consciousness despite her pleading for him to stop, according to court papers. “While doing so, Tate told her repeatedly that if she ever crossed him, he was going to kill her,” the lawsuit said. Ms. Stern said she sought medical attention after their stay at the hotel and was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. She waited to report the assault to the police until after the brothers left the United States — they returned to Romania on March 22 for a hearing there — because she was afraid of retaliation, the complaint said. In her lawsuit, Ms. Stern provided screenshots of what she said were text messages that she had exchanged Mr. Tate: “if you ever betray me you will regret it.”In another text, the lawsuit said, Mr. Tate wrote, “Whats the point in having you” and continued, “if i don’t beat you and impregnate you.”The Beverly Hills Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the allegations in the lawsuit. In a statementsharedon hersocial media accountson Thursday, Ms. Stern said that she had been in love with Mr. Tate, but added that the events described in the lawsuit had prompted her to end the relationship. “Coming out about this is really terrifying in all aspects,” she wrote. “The entire situation is very traumatic and extremely difficult.”Ms. Stern said that she was reluctant to speak up. “I know he and his followers will insult me and attack me,” she said. “I don’t care because I speak the truth.”Although they are allowed to travel outside of Romania after the authorities therelifted travel restrictions on them, Mr. Tate and his brotherare still being investigatedfor allegations of criminal wrongdoing. A group of women in Britain who sued Andrew Tate over claims of sexual assault have also lobbied the British government to extradite the brothers,while another lawsuitis playing out in a Florida court between the brothers and an American woman who gave testimony to Romanian authorities.

They left with little clarity on the coalition’s plans. Reporting from ParisTrump Is Giving Europe Vertigo, and Not Just About Ukrainenews analysisThe split between Europe and the United States over how to end the war is exposing a new, disorienting reality for an alliance in trouble. If progress in ending the war in Ukraine requires cohesion between allies, there seems to be little or none for now. A flurry of diplomatic talks this week did less to advance a truce, let alone a peace, than to illustrate the uneasy discord growing between Europe and the United States. As they huddled in Paris, European leaders made clear that their priority is a free, democratic and stable Ukraine able to withstand any further Russian aggression. “We must place Ukraine in the strongest position to negotiate a solid and durable peace,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Thursday. The Trump administration, meanwhile, pursued its rush to end the three-year-old war fast andon favorable economic terms for the United States. Those terms include a revived relationship with Russia and substantial recompense from a Ukraine seen as insufficiently grateful for American support. As a result, the allies, if they are still that, resembled ships passing in the night, with President Trump on course to reward President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, while Europeans anchored themselves to a refusal to do so. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine being greeted by President Emmanuel Macron of France ahead of the “coalition of the willing” summit on Thursday. A U.S.-brokered deal to stop fighting in the Black Sea was reached in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, without a European presence. But it immediately became unclear whether the agreement would be enforced soon — if at all. The Trump administration and the Kremlin offered three versions of its terms, as Moscow conditioned the deal on the removal of economic sanctions, a move that requires European support and faces stiff European opposition. In Paris, where European leaders gathered without American officials, the discussion was about how to dispatch an eventual “reassurance force” to bolster any Ukrainian truce. But the so-called coalition of the willing began to look more like a coalition of the reluctant. It was unclear which countries would participate and where the troops would deploy. Moscow warned of a direct Russia-NATO military clash if they did. After the meeting, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who attended the talks, declared that “nobody is going to give our territory to Putin.” This, he added, “is our common position — at least those present today.” The United States believes peace without territorial concessions from Ukraine is impossible. The disagreements between Europe and Washington go much deeper than disputes over Ukraine. Europe is afflicted with vertigo. It is unsure whether Mr. Trump now regards it as a strategic and ideological rival, which would be a world-changing shift, or merely wants Europe to assume its own defense responsibilities. The latter would be a brutal shock, but perhaps an inevitable and manageable one. “The reconfiguration of the alliance demanded by Trump can feel more like the end of the alliance,” said Michel Duclos, a special adviser to the Institut Montaigne, a research organization in Paris. “There is no longer even the pretense of a relationship of equals.”European leaders meeting in Paris this week discussed the creation of a “reassurance force” should Ukraine agree to a cease-fire with Russia. The linchpin of the alliance has long been Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which promises that “an armed attack against one or more” of the alliance’s member states “shall be considered an attack against them all” and met, if necessary, “by the use of armed force.” But that vow seems shakier than a few months ago. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States spends too much on Europe’s security and promised to force European nations to increase their military budgets, which has begun to happen but not to his satisfaction. With the Cold War long gone, he has threatened not to defend NATO allies that don’t pay up. Such threats have escalated in his second term. This has led to widespread unease. France is preparing to distribute a “resilience manual” to every household to help citizens prepare for threats, including armed conflict on French soil. At the same time, Mr. Macron announced a $2.1 billion plan to modernize an air base and equip it to host next-generation Rafale fighter jets able to deliver hypersonic nuclear missiles. “What has become increasingly clear is that Trump’s team sees Europe as a parasitic freeloading ally and its liberal democracies as political and ideological adversaries,” said Célia Belin, the head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign relations. “But this is so contradictory to everything the United States has stood for that we are bound to ask: Can America really tilt this way?”The United States has long been an idea as well as a nation. It would be a spectacular inversion of its alliances and values for Mr. Trump’s America to not only set about unraveling the European Union, an alliance he has described as created to “screw” the United States, but also to celebrate illiberal, nationalist states like Hungary. President Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday, after signing an order on tariffs on imported cars. Yet, with Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, calling European freeloading “PATHETIC” in a leaked conversation on the Signal messaging app among top Trump administration officials, and with a tone of dismissive contempt for Europe coming from Washington, such an American strategic objective no longer seems far-fetched. Mr. Putin’s nationalism and conservative values appear to hold significant appeal for the Trump administration, perhaps more than the liberal democracies Vice President JD Vanceassailedduring a visit to Europe last month for allegedly refusing to listen to voters. “It seems there has been a seismic change,” Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to the United States, told the House of Lords this month, alluding to the difficulties of intelligence sharing when there are people in the Trump administration who are “looking for ways to appease Russia.”These, he said, “are not our values.”The Trump administration argues that it has a mandate to push back against what it views as the left’s political correctness and to seek through re-engagement with Moscow an end to a bloody war started by Russia. It will not be easy, given European divisions and budgetary constraints, for the continent to end its reliance on U.S. military might and pursue a program of aggressive rearmament, but over a five- to 10-year period it is conceivable. German rearmament would change the face of Europe; it would certainly cause Moscow to take note. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, speaking with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and President Nikos Christodoulides of Cyprus at a Ukraine summit at the Élysée Palace on Thursday. What feels inconceivable to many Europeans, however, is dealing with an America that has become an adversary, whether in the short-term goal of reaching a peace settlement in Ukraine or the longer-term aim of limiting the power and influence of autocrats from Beijing to Ankara. In the view of Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, the Trump administration is following a familiar playbook toward strongman rule. “First the judges, then the universities, then the press, then the lawyers — there are no rules Trump is not willing to break,” he said. Nobody, of course, knows what Mr. Trump’s ultimate intentions are, but alarm is widespread in Europe. Ms. Belin said that just as Mr. Trump appears determined toweaken checks and balancesat home, he is seeking to replicate that externally, dispensing with any rules-based or values-based order. “Anything that is a check on whatever he wants to do on whatever day, including Article 5, is something he may tear up,” she said. “What counts in Trump world are power and interests. For Europe the choice may come down to this: Show teeth or give him what he wants.”For now, on Ukraine, Europe seems determined to show teeth rather than offer Mr. Putin a victory perceived as threatening the entire continent. Beyond that, a great European disorientation is apparent. “The only hope is the American people,” Mr. Duclos said. Ségolène Le StradicandAurelien Breedencontributed reporting.

Airlines Cut Seats to the U.S. as Canadians Stay Away,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html,2025-03-28T20:16:59Z,World,"Several airlines have reduced the number of seats on U.S.-bound flights in April, while industry data shows that bookings have declined significantly.",Airlines and Airplanes; International Trade and World Market; Travel and Vacations; Consumer Behavior,"Trump, Donald J",Canada; Florida; United States,Air Canada; United Airlines,"An Air Canada plane taking off from Vancouver International Airport. The airline has reduced the number of seats to the United States. Vjosa Isai reported from Toronto and Christine Chung from New York. Airlines Cut Seats to the U.S. as Canadians Stay AwaySeveral airlines have reduced the number of seats on U.S.-bound flights in April, while industry data shows that bookings have declined significantly. Airlines are having to revamp their plans ahead of the peak summer travel season as Canadians avoid trips to the United States amid an escalating trade war between the two neighbors. A grass roots effort by Canadians to boycott all things American — from U.S. grocery products and alcohol to tourist hot spots — had already set off alarms across the United States travel industry, which warned ofmultibillion-dollar losses. Now, about two months since President Trump took office and launched an attack against Canada’s economy and its sovereignty, the fallout from Canadians’ resulting anger is becoming clearer. Canadian airlines are eliminating tens of thousands of seats to the United States this April, a peak period when Canadians travel to warmer destinations. The reductions range from 7 percent by Air Canada to 25 percent by Flair Airlines, a discount airline, according toVisual Approach Analytics, an aviation research company. “We’re seeing Canadians book away from the U.S.,” said Courtney Miller, the founder and managing director of Visual Approach Analytics. “The Canadian airlines are feeling this effect disproportionately.”Travel agencies, in response, are also changing how they advertise flight packages. “We completely stopped promoting the U.S. because of the backlash from the consumers,” said Flemming Friisdahl, the chief executive of The Travel Agent Next Door, a Canadian company with 1,500 travel agents in its network. The agency is selling far fewer trips to the United States, he added, as travelers redirect their spending to destinations in Europe and elsewhere. An Air Canada plane after departing from Pearson International Airport in Toronto. Fewer Canadians are traveling to the United States. “It’s such a shame that we’re in this position today because we’ve always been amazing neighbors,” Mr. Friisdahl said. Air Canada, the country’s largest airline, said it would be reducing some U.S. flights to warmer destinations “to reflect commercial demand,” Christophe Hennebelle, a spokesman for the airline, said in an email. Just how large the drop in demand is remains a little up for debate. OAG Aviation Worldwide Limited, an analytics company based in the United Kingdom, said advance bookings for routes between Canada and the United States from April through October aredownby roughly 70 percent, compared with the same time period last year. While airlines have seen a decrease in demand, some said it has not been as pronounced as what OAG said. “No data source is showing a decline of the magnitude that OAG is reporting — for Air Canada or in the market overall,” Mr. Hennebelle said. Brad Cicero, a spokesman for Porter Airlines, said air travel between Canada and the United States remained robust, adding that the airline was “finalizing the summer schedule to ensure that flights are deployed where there is the greatest demand.”John Grant, the analyst who prepared the OAG report, said the data had been supplied by a major travel distribution company, but he could not divulge its name because of an agreement with the provider. Canadian residents took about 586,000 trips to the United States in February, a 13 percent drop from the same month last year, according to Canada’s national census agency. In a recentreport, it also found that the number of car trips across the border in February fell to 1.2 million from about 1.5 million in February 2024. Canadian seasonal travelers who spend part of the year insunny American states, known as snowbirds, are part of the shifting tide. Florida is the destination feeling the greatest effect from the reduction in seats on flights from Canada, the report from Visual Approach Analytics said, with airports in Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers and Orlando seeing up to a 30 percent cut in April. Major airlines in the United States are also responding to falling demand from Canadians. Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, recently said the airline had reduced the frequency ofnumerous routesto Canada because of a “big drop in Canadian traffic” into the United States. United canceled a new daily route between Toronto and Los Angeles that it had planned to begin in May and said it would also reduce the frequency ofother existing routesto Canada. Beyond any desire to boycott America, a weaker Canadian dollar has made the United States more expensive and is alsopart of the equationfor some travelers. “The exchange rate certainly helps us be more firm in our expression of not wanting to go the U.S.,” said Katherine Velan, a travel adviser based in Montreal. Some travelers are opting for Mexico, Cuba, Costa Rica and other destinations where the Canadian dollar stretches further. Ms. Velan, who spoke while on vacation herself in Costa Rica, said she and her friends had encountered a group of Americans while dining out who sent a bottle of wine to her  table. “They said, ‘Oh my God, we’re so sorry. We love Canadians.’”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move.

Dachshund Lost on Australian Island Is Still Alive, but ElusiveA year after getting loose on Kangaroo Island, Valerie is still out there. A dachshund lost in Australia is still alive after more than a year, and still apparently wearing her pink collar. But she has proved elusive to recapture. The tale begins in November 2023 when a couple took their pet miniature dachshund, Valerie, to Kangaroo Island off the coast of Adelaide. But Valerie escaped from her pen and rushed off into the bush. The couple scrapped their plans and searched for their pet for five days with the help of locals before finally giving up and returning to their home in New South Wales. “It was like finding a needle in a haystack,” Valerie’s owner Josh Fishlock toldthe “Today” show in Australia. A surveillance image of Valerie. She was identified, in part, by her pink collar. (Yes, the Australian island where Valerie went missing is called Kangaroo Island. Its Aboriginal name is Karta Pintingga, meaning “island of the dead.” Given Valerie’s predicament, we’re going to stick with Kangaroo Island.)Now, more than a year after Valerie’s disappearance, hope has sprung. “Based on firsthand accounts and video evidence, we now know that Valerie is alive,”Kangala Wildlife Rescuesaid in a statement on social media last week. She was spotted about 10 miles from where she disappeared, in Stokes Bay, and was identified, in part, by her pink collar. Efforts are now underway to rescue the dachshund, but that has proved difficult. “She runs at the first sign of humans or vehicles and despite the best efforts of dedicated island locals, Valerie has been impossible to catch,” the wildlife rescue said. “We are using surveillance and various trapping and luring methods in the area she was last seen to try and bring her home,” the statement said. “This is a tiny dog in a huge area, and we will need help from the public to report any sightings and a lot of luck.”On Thursday, a man who identified himself as “Jared, one of the Kangala team members that’s involved in the rescue mission for Valerie,” offereda heartening update in a video update: “We have seen her. We’ve managed to narrow down the search area to one specific point.”“We were initially skeptical, but we kept getting more and more sightings,” Mr. Fishlock told “Today.”Her other owner, Georgia Gardner,told The Guardian: “She was not a very outside, rough-and-tough dog. To think that she even went one night outside in the rain, oh my gosh. To think that she’s gone a year and a half is incredible.”While the first image of a dachshund might be of a cute little wiener dog, the breed has some real survival skills. “Dachshunds aren’t built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything,”the American Kennel Club saysin its description of the breed. “Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness.”The wildlife rescue said, “We hope to be able to update you all with an amazing outcome.”Lost PetsHang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Reporting from Bangkok, Seoul and New YorkMajor Quake Batters Myanmar; High Toll Is Feared as Buildings ToppleThe 7.7-magnitude earthquake near Mandalay, in a country already torn by war, was felt across Southeast Asia, and experts warned there could be tens of thousands dead. A powerful earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday, gouging open roads, toppling century-old religious monuments and destroying multistory buildings as it shook a vast expanse of Southeast Asia and dealt another severe blow to a country that has been ripped apart by civil war. While the death toll remains unclear, expert estimates warned it could be extraordinary, given the dense population and vulnerable structures near the epicenter, just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimated that the death toll was likely tosurpass 10,000, and that there was a strong possibility of a much higher toll. A preliminary count from Myanmar’s military government said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — but that did not include Mandalay. The quake, measured by the U.S.G.S. at magnitude 7.7, was strong enough that it leveled a 33-story building that was under construction more than 600 miles away in Bangkok, in neighboring Thailand. At least eight people were confirmed dead there, and dozens more were missing, according to the authorities. They were all presumed to be members of the 320-person crew of workers who were putting up the new building for the Thai government. The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. local time, was only the third of its size to hit the region in the past century, and theU.S.G.S. analysisplaced the epicenter just 10 miles from the heart of Mandalay, a city of about 1.5 million people. An aftershock of magnitude 6.7 was recorded about 11 minutes later, the first of several sizable tremors that followed the first one. The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand andsouthern China, where state news media reported that an unspecified number of people had been injured in Ruili, near the Myanmar border. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand declared Bangkok an “area of emergency” and urged residents to evacuate tall buildings in case of aftershocks. A rescue worker carrying an earthquake survivor as she waits to receive medical attention at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. In Myanmar, as bleeding victims rushed to hospitals by ambulance, car and motorbike, a surgeon at Mandalay General Hospital said that so many people had arrived for treatment that nurses had run out of cotton swabs and that he had nowhere to stand. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said the surgeon, Dr. Kyaw Zin. Because phone lines were down, he said, he was unsure if his parents had survived. “But I can’t go back home yet,” he said. “I have to save lives here first.”Dozens of patients at the hospital — the main medical center in Mandalay — fled the building when it jolted and shuddered, jamming together in a nearby parking lot. Some patients were still connected to intravenous drips and oxygen tanks. Others had their heads and arms bandaged and were lined up on stretchers, moaning. Many more were lying on cardboard, or directly on the concrete in the 100-degree heat. The earthquake forced patients from a hospital to flee to a nearby parking lot in Mandalay. Outside the hospital, Daw Kyi Shwin, 45, who was bleeding heavily, said that her 3-year-old daughter had been killed when their house began to collapse while they were having lunch. “I tried to run to her,” she said, “but before I could, bricks fell on me, too.”Photos and videos from Myanmar showed scenes of stunning devastation. The Ava Bridge, a giant metal span, had partially collapsed into the Irrawaddy River. In Mandalay, monks in reddish robes cried out in shock as a multistory building at the New Masoeyein monastery fell near a toppled clock tower. At a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, about 70 miles from the epicenter, women wailed as the spire atop a century-old golden dome called a stupa toppled over, one of several that were damaged there. Rescue workers in other parts of the country dug through piles of twisted rebar and jagged concrete where buildings had been destroyed. Among the hard-hit places was Naypyidaw, the capital of the military government, about 150 miles from Mandalay. The disaster compounded the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021 and have restricted the country’s contact with the outside world. The junta has been steadily weakened since then, losing ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat has left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials.

During past disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, Myanmar’s military rulers restricted the flow of international aid to hard-hit areas that were dominated by their foes. But this time, the junta’s leaders immediately appealed for international help and declared a state of emergency in six regions of the country, news agencies reported, including Mandalay and Naypyidaw. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said a military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Volunteers looking for survivors in the wreckage of an earthquake-damaged building in Naypyidaw, on Friday. The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said the organization was mobilizing to help people in need. The U.N. said it had allocated an initial $5 million from its emergency fund to help lifesaving operations in Myanmar. President Trump said the United States would also provide assistance to Myanmar. “It’s a real bad one, and we will be helping,” he said in the Oval Office. “We’ve already spoken with the country.”Aid organizations said that it was difficult to assess the full scope of the damage in many parts of Myanmar because electricity and communication lines were down. In addition,the junta has repeatedly shut off the internetand cut off access to social media, isolating the country. The crackdown on internet access, intended to stifle dissent, could make it difficult to coordinate the delivery of aid. The military has ruled Myanmar oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the military could slow the delivery of supplies, deny visas to relief workers or direct more aid to areas nominally under its control, shortchanging areas under opposition control. An entrance to the emergency department of a hospital in Naypyidaw. Mr. Martin said it was unclear to what extent the United States would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Even before the quake, Myanmar’s health care system had been pushed to its limits. The junta has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a civil disobedience movement opposed to the regime. Myanmar is consideredone of the most dangerous places in the worldto be a health worker, according to the New York-based Physicians for Human Rights. Backed by military and financial support from China, India, Russia and Thailand, the junta controls about 20 percent of Myanmar, mainly urban areas. Its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has been accused of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The military has persecuted ethnic minorities, particularly Rohingya Muslims, who have endured ascorched-earth campaignof arson, mass rape and killing that the United Stateshas called genocide.

Video of the collapse showed panicked construction workers running for safety and people on the street scrambling for cover, as a thick cloud of dust quickly enveloped the scene. About 70 people were taken to local hospitals and two people were rescued from the rubble. Hours later, rescue workers and dogs searched for survivors amid fears that scores of people had been buried in the collapse. In Mandalay, as the night deepened, terrified residents dragged mattresses and mosquito nets onto the streets to sleep. Others planned to spend the night in their cars. Many were too scared to return to their homes. Myanmar is in one of the world’smost seismically active regions, where the Eurasian and Indian plates of the Earth’s crust grind against each other.

Protests Demanding Restoration of Monarchy in Nepal Turn Deadly,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/nepal-protests-monarchy-violence.html,2025-03-28T18:50:18Z,World,At least two people were killed and dozens injured as followers of the last king demanded the restoration of a monarchy that was dissolved in 2008.,"Demonstrations, Protests and Riots; Royal Families; Politics and Government; Police","Oli, K P Sharma",Kathmandu (Nepal); Nepal,,"Police securing the site of a building set on fire by a pro-monarchist group during a protest in Kathmandu, Nepal, on Friday. Reporting from Kathmandu, NepalProtests Demanding Restoration of Monarchy in Nepal Turn DeadlyAt least two people were killed and dozens injured as followers of the last king demanded the restoration of a monarchy that was dissolved in 2008. At least two people were killed and dozens of others were injured in Nepal on Friday as protesters calling for the restoration of the monarchy in the Himalayan nation clashed with security forces, officials said. The protesters are calling for the return of Gyanendra Shah, the last royal ruler of Nepal before the monarchy was dissolved in 2008 in favor of a secular republic. They are demanding a constitutional monarchy that declares Nepal a parliamentary democracy with a Hindu identity. The two dead were identified as a protester and a television journalist, according to Dinesh Kumar Acharya, a spokesman for the Nepali police. The protester died of bullet wounds, while the journalist died after protesters set fire to a building from which he was filming, Mr. Acharya added. He said that at least 30 civilians and 40 police personnel were among the injured. The government declared a curfew in large parts of the capital city, Kathmandu, and deployed the army to help restore order. A pro-monarchist protester, hurling stones at police officers on Friday. Monarchists have begun a fresh wave of protests in recent months, accusing established political parties, including that of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, of being corrupt and of failing to lead the country out of poverty and political chaos. Earlier this month, Mr. Oli rejected the idea of returning to a monarchy and said that the former king could instead run in the next elections in 2027,according to Nepali media. “If he wants to rise to power, let him contest elections in the mountains, hills or Tarai,” the lowland region, Mr. Oli was reported as saying. “Our constitution does not recognize kings, and no one should dream of reinstating monarchy.”A day after consulting with the former king, the protesters on Thursday gave the government an ultimatum: Restore the monarchy or face intensifying protests. They then called for a large protest on Friday in Kathmandu, and thousands heeded the call. To disperse the protesters, the police deployed a large number of officers, some of whom fired tear gas. The protesters retaliated, vandalizing and setting fire to government offices, shopping malls, private houses and the offices of political parties and news outlets. As the clashing protesters and police moved toward the international airport, authorities briefly halted flights, and the army was deployed to help restore control. Pro-monarchist groups have begun a fresh wave of protests recently. Mr. Shah, the 77-year-old former monarch, remains deeply controversial in Nepal. He stepped down in 2008 in the face of protests, ending approximately 240 years of dynastic rule over the small nation. Much of his family had beenwiped out in 2001 by a troubled prince in a court massacre. Power has frequently changed hands among a small number of parties in Nepal, and its governments have been short-lived. In the chaos of this young democracy, Mr. Shah’s supporters cling to the hope of his return. Political analysts, however, see little chance of a restoration. It would require the Constitution to be amended by parliament, where the monarchists hold very few seats. “Constitutionally, there’s no quick fix,” said Bipin Adhikari, a law professor at Kathmandu University, adding that continued political uncertainty will only open the way for the military to try to play a more central role in a country that is already struggling with poverty and deeply vulnerable to effects of climate change.

The quake struck along a major fault line.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/29/world/earthquake-myanmar-thailand/the-quake-struck-along-a-major-fault-line,2025-03-28T18:30:12Z,World,,,,,,"Myanmar’s military government said the death toll had reached 1,644, though that number is expected to rise significantly. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”David PiersonMyanmar’s military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids.

Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed.

Volunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle. A rescue and medical team departing from Kunming, China, to earthquake-stricken Myanmar on Saturday. Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said. Hong Kong will send search-and-rescue personnel to Myanmar on Saturday from various government agencies, the city’s government said in a statement."

Frantic Effort Underway in Lithuania to Retrieve Vehicle Carrying 4 American SoldiersThe search in dense, muddy swampland came after the U.S. Army vehicle disappeared in a waterlogged area on Tuesday. The president of Lithuania on Friday visited swampland near his country’s border with Belarus, saying he was “hoping for a miracle” as rescue crews worked frantically to extract a heavy United States Army vehicle carryingfour American soldiersthat disappeared in the waterlogged forest. The American vehicle, anM88 Hercules, went missing during a military training exercise and was found on Wednesday submerged in a muddy bog. The soldiers have not been found, and efforts to reach the vehicle have been hampered by deep mud and water from a nearby lake. A Lithuanian official involved in the rescue mission who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter said tracks in the ground indicated that the American vehicle had veered off a sandy path toward a small pond and then turned abruptly into a wooded area that ended up being a swamp. It seemed to have sunk quickly, the person said, but it was unclear what happened to the crew. “Although many skeptics would probably say that there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to hope,” President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania said during a visit to the site on Friday. “I am still hoping for a miracle,” he added. The missing soldiers, from the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, were training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus, a close ally of Russia and a stalwart supporter of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, Kara C. McDonald, speaking to the news media next to Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nauseda, at the site of a rescue operation on Friday. Both Belarus and Russia have frequently criticized Lithuania, a member of NATO that used to be part of the Soviet Union, for hosting American and other allied troops. Amid rising alarm in Lithuania and other formerly communist countries in Eastern Europe that President Trump will weaken the NATO alliance, frantic joint efforts to recover the missing U.S. soldiers by Lithuanian and American rescue crews have showcased what Mr. Nauseda on Friday said was the value of allies acting together. Poland, Lithuania’s neighbor and another member of NATO, has also sent military engineers to help. “Such minutes, such circumstances,” the Lithuanian president said “only confirm how strong we are when we are together, when we are in the NATO alliance and feel the support of our friends.”Mr. Trump and his senior officialshave made it clear in recent weeksthat the security of Europe is no longer the first priority of the United States, which wants to concentrate resources on its own border and the Indo-Pacific, where China has become a peer rival. Mr. Trump suggested this month thatWashington might not protectNATO members that he believed were not paying enough for their own defense, calling it “common sense.”Whether the disaster in Lithuania will reinforce the administration’s view that the United States is paying too high a price to defend Europe or help convince it that European allies are pulling their weight remains to be seen. The U.S. military, in astatement issuedon Thursday, praised Lithuania for its efforts to find the missing soldiers. At the site of a rescue operation in Lithuania on Friday. “We are incredibly appreciative of the dedicated and professional efforts of our Lithuanian allies in ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel,” said Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, the commanding general of First Armored Division. “They have worked tirelessly alongside us over the last 48 hours and we continue to be grateful for their support.”Also visiting the site on Friday was the United States ambassador to Lithuania, Kara C. McDonald, who praised Lithuania, which has rushed divers, military engineers and civilian rescue crews to find and work to extract the sunken American military vehicle. “This place is a symbol of our alliance and of working hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, in the search for our missing soldiers,” the ambassador said, describing Lithuania as an exemplary U.S. ally. Ms. McDonald said a team of American Army engineers had arrived on Thursday night and would be assisted in the rescue operation by Navy engineers who were expected to arrive on Friday afternoon. The submerged M88 Hercules, essentially a giant armored tow truck, disappeared on Tuesday after being sent to extract another Army vehicle that had become disabled during the training exercise, according to the military. “Due to the terrain, this is an incredibly complex engineering effort,” Maj. Robin Bruce, a 1st Armored Division engineer, said in the Army statement. Major Bruce added, “The team is exploring every available option to speed up this process.”Lithuania’s defense minister, Dovile Sakaliene, told local news media that the country’s fire and rescue service had worked overnight to pump out water from the swamp but had not uncovered the vehicle, which she said was buried at least five yards beneath the surface. She added that a large dredger would join the effort later on Friday.

Even before the earthquake, the health care system in Myanmar was under stress. In the parking lot of Mandalay General Hospital, dozens of patients — many with their heads and arms bandaged — were lined up on stretchers, or cardboard, in 100-degree heat. Many more lay directly on the concrete. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said Dr. Kyaw Zin, a surgeon at the hospital. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”He said the hospital was so jammed with injured people after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that “there is no space to stand.” Phone lines were down so he has not been able to contact his parents. “I’m very worried about my parents,” he added. “But I can’t go back home yet. I have to save lives here first.”Even before the quake, the health care system in Myanmar had been pushed to its limits. The military junta that has led the country since a 2021 coup has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has opposed the regime. Myanmar isone of the most dangerous places in the worldto be a health worker, according to New York-based Physicians for Human Rights. Dr. Kyaw Zin said that he was about to start surgery when the earthquake struck. Everybody, including patients, ran outside. On Friday afternoon, ambulance sirens shrieked. The injured kept coming. Nurses checked on patients in the parking lot, some of whom were hooked up to intravenous drips. People moaned for help. The smell of blood hung in the stifling heat. The junta said it did not have the full death toll. Damage to infrastructure could hinder access to regions that have already been struggling amid a bloody civil war. The epicenter of the earthquake, the Sagaing region, has been a focus of resistance to military rule. The World Health Organization said information was still hard to get because of aftershocks and disruptions to communications systems. The agency added that it was looking to send trauma supplies from its logistics hubs to support Myanmar.

Reporting from Kyiv, UkraineU.S. Revives Tough Demands in Reworked Deal for Ukraine’s MineralsOfficials in Kyiv say the country cannot possibly accept the proposal and that new negotiations would be needed. But they have not rejected it outright, which would anger the White House. More than a month after Washington and Kyiv first haggled over a deal to grant the United States a major stake in Ukraine’s mineral, oil and gas development projects, the two sides are back to square one in the negotiations. Washington has sent Kyiv a new proposal that restates thesweeping financial demands from an initial draft agreementrejected by Ukraine, and adds new ones that could burden the country’s finances for years, according to the text of the new draft obtained by The New York Times, and authenticated and reviewed by three current and former Ukrainian officials. Several Ukrainian lawmakers suggested that Ukraine could not possibly accept such a deal and that new negotiations would be needed. President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in Paris on Thursday that the new proposal required “detailed study” and suggested that a final agreement was still far-off. But he also said he did not want “to leave the U.S. with the feeling that Ukraine is against it in general.”“We support cooperation with the U.S.,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We don’t want to send any signals that could lead the U.S. to stop aid to Ukraine.”It was a clear attempt to avoid angering the White House, as he did last month afterrejecting earlier proposals, which partly led the United States to temporarily cut off aid to Ukraine. What Echoes the Earlier Proposals? The new proposal reverts toPresident Trump’s initial demand that Ukraine repay the United Statesfor the billions Kyiv has received in military and financial aid since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago, according to the three current and former Ukrainian officials, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The new draft also echoes earlier versions by omitting any mention of security guarantees for Ukraine, aprovision that Kyiv had long pressed for and managed to include in a draftlast month but that Washington had long resisted. As in earlier proposals, Ukraine would have to contribute half of its revenue from natural resource projects and related infrastructure such as ports and pipelines to a U.S.-controlled investment fund. Profit from the fund would be reinvested in Ukrainian natural resource projects, though the exact share of such profit remained unclear. What’s New? The new proposal is more specific about how profit would be shared: Washington would claim all profit from the fund until Kyiv repaid at least the equivalent of the U.S. aid received during the war plus 4 percent annual interest. The United States also would retain a “right of first offer” on new projects and the power to veto sales of Ukrainian resources to third countries. And in the first year of the agreement, Ukraine would be prohibited from offering any investment projects to third parties with better financial or economic terms than those offered to the United States. The new proposal also outlines specifics for the role of the International Development Finance Corporation, a U.S. government agency responsible for investing in companies and projects abroad. The agency would control the fund by nominating three board members, while Ukraine would have only two. The agency would also oversee each project where earnings from the fund are invested. Why Is Trump Reviving Tougher Terms? Mr. Trump has long beeninterested in Ukraine’s mineral resources— including lithium and titanium, crucial for manufacturing modern technologies — arguing that gaining access would be a way to “recoup” the aid the United States has given Ukraine. After intense negotiations on a minerals deal, Ukraine last month managed to soften some of Washington’s toughest demands andreached an agreement that Kyiv considered more acceptable. But the deal collapsed after adisastrous Oval Office meetingbetween Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. Now, demands that Kyiv had previously succeeded in removing — that Washington retains control of the fund and that Ukraine repays past U.S. aid — have resurfaced in the latest proposal, which Mr. Zelensky said he received a few days ago. The security guarantees also disappeared. The new proposal “effectively turns Ukraine into an American colony,” Roman Sheremeta, a Ukrainian economist and founding rector of the American University in Kyiv,wrote on X. The proposal was first reported on Thursday evening byAmericanandBritishnews outlets, includingThe Financial Times, which published thenew 55-page draft. What Happens Next? Yaroslav Zhelezniak, an opposition Ukrainian lawmaker who obtained the new draft and revealed its main points in avideo on Thursday, said he considered the new demands an opening bid for more negotiations. “I’m sure it will be updated,” he said in an interview Thursday, adding, “There is zero chance that it will be approved as it is now.”Still, officials in Kyiv on Friday did not outright reject the new American demands, mindful that previous refusals had strained relations between the U.S. and Ukraine. “It would be irresponsible to criticize this document because it is still being negotiated,” Oleksii Movchan, a member of Mr. Zelensky’s party and the deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee on economic development, said by phone on Friday. “The goal is to continue negotiations and find a compromise.”Black Sea Cease-Fire: Ukrainian Navy officers and business owners in Odesa, a port city,pondered what Kyiv could gain from a truceafter it pushed back Russian vessels and resumed commercial shipping.

"Vance Makes Quick Trip to Greenland, a Place That Doesn’t Want Him",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/jd-vance-greenland-visit-denmark-us.html,2025-03-28T14:05:26Z,World,"Vice President JD Vance’s trip to an island that President Trump wants to “get” was a scaled-back version of the original White House plan. “He’s not welcome,” one Greenlander said.",United States International Relations,"Vance, J D; Vance, Usha",Denmark; Greenland; United States,,"Vice President JD Vance arriving at a remote U.S. military facility, the Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland on Friday. Jeffrey Gettleman reported from London, and Maya Tekeli from Nuuk, Greenland. Vance Makes Quick Trip to Greenland, a Place That Doesn’t Want HimVice President JD Vance’s trip to an island that President Trump wants to “get” was a scaled-back version of the original White House plan. “He’s not welcome,” one Greenlander said. Vice President JD Vance spent three hours in Greenland on Friday touring a U.S. military base, on a contentious trip pushed by the Trump administration and angrily opposed by Greenlanders. In remarks with reporters, Mr. Vance said the United States had to “wake up” to China and Russia’s designs on the island. “We can’t just bury our head in the sand,” he said, “or, in Greenland, bury our head in the snow.”President Trump has been insisting that the United States take over the icebound island, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark and has been connected to Denmark for more than 300 years. Mr. Trump has been fixated on Greenland since his first term in office and recently vowed to “get it — one way or the other.”Mr. Vance took a softer tone, saying that the United States would respect Greenland’s right to self-determination and that using military force, which Mr. Trump refused to rule out, would not be necessary. But Greenlanders have resisted the overtures. The government of Greenland did not invite Mr. Vance or the others in his group, which included his wife, Usha, as well as the national security adviser and the energy secretary. Protests had been planned in Nuuk, the capital, where Ms. Vance was originally scheduled to visit, and that part of the trip was scrapped a few days ago. Instead, the entire visit was reduced to thePituffik Space Base, a missile defense station far from any town — or any chance of an embarrassing TV moment. The White House’s original plan was for Ms. Vance to attend a famous dog sled race this weekend and see other cultural sites, in an effort to bring the United States and Greenland closer. The planbackfired. Protesters were gearing up to line the road from the airport into town. Greenland’s government blasted the visit as “highly aggressive.” Even the organizers of the dog sled race said they never asked Ms. Vance to attend in the first place. A spokeswoman for Ms. Vance contested that, saying she had received “multiple invitations.”The Pituffik Space Base, an American missile defense station nearly a thousand miles from where protests had been planned against the U.S. visit. As the Vances sat down for lunch at the base, Mr. Vance made a colorful remark about how cold it was and said, “Nobody told me,” prompting laughs. The national security adviser, Michael Waltz, gave a few remarks but said nothing about the intense criticism he was facing fordiscussing military plans over a messaging appin a group that included a journalist. Foreign policy analysts said the revised trip was a watered-down version of what the White House really wanted. “It’s a tactical retreat,” said Lars Trier Mogensen, a political analyst based in Copenhagen. “On the one hand, they de-escalated by not carrying out the full cultural mission and skipping the P.R. stunt. On the other hand, it’s a symbolic escalation that the highest-ranking official is visiting Greenland.”Mr. Vance is the most senior American official to ever visit the island, according to foreign policy experts. Greenland’s size — it’s the world’s largest island — and its location in North America along the increasingly contested Arctic Ocean seems to be the root of Mr. Trump’s fascination. Members of his inner circle, including Mr. Vance, have also spoken of Greenland’s“incredible natural resources” (though most of them are buried under ice). Just this week, Mr. Trump again insisted that Greenland was vital to American security, saying, “We need it. We have to have it.”Greenland had beensteadily inching away from Denmark, with the island gaining more power over its own affairs and Greenlanders showing more interest in independence. There is — or was, until recently — a significant movement within Greenland that wanted to form a closer alliance with the United States, which has stationed troops on the island since World War II. But the mood is turning against Mr. Trump, and many ordinary Greenlanders didn’t want Mr. Vance to come at all. Mr. Vance and the second lady, Usha Vance, boarding Air Force Two in Maryland on Friday for Greenland. “I don’t know what he wants,” said Tupaarnaq Kanuthsen, a woman walking through Nuuk on Friday. “He’s not welcome.”Shortly before Mr. Vance arrived, Greenland announced a new government; the island held elections a few weeks ago but no party won a majority. The new government will be a coalition of all the island’s major parties except one — the Naleraq party, which has the closest connections to Mr. Trump. One of the party’s prominent members has been open about his support for Mr. Trump and attended the president’s inauguration. Politicians from the ruling coalition downplayed the significance of their exclusion of the Naleraq party, citing other reasons they couldn’t work with its members. But members of Naleraq, which came in second during the election, didn’t buy it. “I think our party has been misunderstood,” said Qupanuk Olsen, a well-known social media influencer elected on the Naleraq ticket. “Being open to cooperation with the U.S. is being interpreted as sucking up to them,” she said. “But it’s really just about openness to business and trade. Trump is only president for four more years; we have to think 10, 20 years ahead. We can’t just shut out the U.S. completely.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

Climate Activists Who Threw Soup at van Gogh Painting Are Changing Tactics,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/climate-activists-museum-protests.html,2025-03-28T13:23:21Z,World,"Just Stop Oil, the group that made headlines for high-profile stunts to protest use of fossil fuels, said it was ending protests in museums after achieving its initial demand.",Museums,"Starmer, Keir; Sunak, Rishi (1980- )",England; London (England),Just Stop Oil,"“Just Stop Oil” demonstrators during an action outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, in January. Reporting from LondonClimate Activists Who Threw Soup at van Gogh Painting Are Changing TacticsJust Stop Oil, the group that made headlines for high-profile stunts to protest use of fossil fuels, said it was ending protests in museums after achieving its initial demand. Just Stop Oil, the British environmental activist group known for attention-grabbing protests — including throwing tomato soup at famous artworks and spraying orange powder on Stonehenge — said it was ending such actions after a final protest in London next month. The group said on Thursday that it had achieved its primary goal of preventing new oil and gas licensing in Britain, and would soon be regrouping to plan its next phase of actions. “We achieved what we set out to achieve,” James Skeet, a spokesman for the group, said in an interview. Here’s what to know. The activists are known for attention-grabbing protests. Just Stop Oil activists made headlines beginning in 2022 for: throwing tomato soupat Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers,”gluing themselvesto John Constable’s “The Hay Wain,”and smashing the glass that protectedDiego Velázquez’s “Rokeby Venus.”The group has said that it used the tactics to convey the urgency of the climate crisis, and draw attention to the political and social changes needed to tackle it. The group has noted that its actions have not damaged the masterpieces, and that the works were specifically chosen because they were protected by glass. But critics have argued that some of the works’ centuries-old frames were harmed. Just Stop Oil demonstrators splashed soup onto Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and glued their hands to the National Gallery wall in London, in 2022. A wave of similar protest actions began in Paris when a mansmeared cake on the Mona Lisa, and others occurred inGermany,Italyand theUnited States. Just Stop Oil, which also disruptedsporting eventsawards showsandlive theater, as well asspraying the monoliths at Stonehengewith orange powder, grew out of Extinction Rebellion, a British environmentalist group that promoted nonviolent protests to push governments to address the climate crisis. Officials condemned the stunts, and some activists got jail time. Politicians, museum managers and many others on social media have condemned the group’s actions. In Britain, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called Just Stop Oil “a disgrace,” and Keir Starmer, the current leader, called the group “pathetic” after its Stonehenge protest. Many of the activists who participated in the 2022 protests at the National Gallery in London were arrested, and some were sentenced to jail time. A judgesentenced two of the activistswho threw soup at the “Sunflowers” painting to about two years in jail in 2024, and a protester who glued himself to the frame of another van Gogh work was sentenced tothree weeksin prison in 2022. The case of the activists involved in the Stonehenge protests is ongoing. The activists who threw soup at “Sunflowers” had their sentencesupheld this month. But six activists who were convicted of conspiracy for blocking a major highway near London in 2022 during a Just Stop Oil protest had their sentences reduced. Mr. Skeet said 15 people were currently in prison related to Just Stop Oil protests and 16 others were facing sentencing in the coming months. The museum campaign also had its defenders. They argued that the actions drew needed attention to the climate crisis. It also sparked a debate about whether vandalizing artshould be a vehicle for protestJust Stop Oil protesters gathered at a London court in 2024 before the sentencing for the activists who defaced van Gogh’s “Sunflowers”They met their goal: a ban on new licenses for oil and gas. Mr. Skeet, the group’s spokesman, said Just Stop Oil’s tactics were narrowly focused on pushing for an end to new oil and gas licensing in Britain. The Labour Party, which swept into power last year, committed to a ban on new licensees for oil and gas, anddoubled down on its pledgethis month. The group’s final action will take place in London on April 26, but the organization made clear on its website that it will be “a lower-risk action, and we won’t be pushing for arrest.”Mr. Skeet added: “The idea around the strategy was to aim for a winnable demand and basically sort of prove the effectiveness of the tactics, essentially. We’ve done so. So now it’s on to moving on to the next thing.”What’s next for the group? “My first priority is to take a break,” Mr. Skeet said. He said the last few years have exhausted many of the members. Mr. Skeet also said that the group’s style of protesting has become increasingly criminalized since the organization first began. In 2023, a new law, the Public Order Act, gave the police in England and Wales more power to detain and charge protesters. Mr. Skeet said the group would need to “assess the lay of the land” before regrouping for further action. “Obviously the work isn’t done yet,” Mr. Skeet said, noting that average global temperatureshave continued to climb in recent years.

They were one of several rebel forces that have galvanized since Myanmar’s coup. Lara Jakes covers global conflicts and diplomacy. Since seizing power four years ago, the military junta that controls Myanmar has gradually become so weakened that some analysts have predicted it could soon collapse, in a scenario similar to the rebel overthrow of Syria’s government in December. With the financial and military backing of benefactors — including China, India, Russia and Thailand — the junta has managed to maintain its grip. It controls about 20 percent of the territory, mainly urban areas, amid a civil war that had left nearly 20 million people without sufficient food, shelter or security even before Friday’s earthquake, according to a report this week by the United Nations humanitarian aid agency. Myanmar’sbleak economyhas stirred widespread anger against the junta, which has grappled withhigh levels of defections. Its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing,has been accusedof crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. General Min Aung Hlaing has kept up persecution of ethnic minorities, including this montharresting the leaderof an armed group that has sought to protect Rohingya Muslims from ascorched-earth campaignof arson, mass rape and killing that the United Stateshas called genocide. The Trump administration so far has taken a largely hands-off approach to Myanmar, although in January itjoined an allianceof democratic countries condemning the junta and urging it to de-escalate violence. The move aims to contain Myanmar’s instability and prevent another surge of people fleeing the country, after about one million Rohingya have already escaped to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. But India, Russia and China all have provided weapons to the junta, and Thailand has given it financial support and defended it against international condemnation,according to an analysisby the Council on Foreign Relations. China, which has sold jets, drones, artillery and electromagnetic jammers to help the junta battle rebels, sees the military-led government as the only force that can hold Myanmar together. But Beijing has hesitated to fully endorse the February 2021 coup and appears to be looking for what theStimson Center, a foreign policy research group, described this month as an “off-ramp” for the junta. Last year, China pledged $3 billion in assistance to the junta, in part to finance a census and some semblance of elections. But the Stimson Center’s report said that “Beijing seems unconvinced that a transition to a federal democratic system is possible.”General Min Aung Hlaing’s recent moves indicate that he is trying at least to be seen as responsive to international pressure. On Thursday, he announced that Myanmar would hold “dignified” elections in December. He is reportedly planning tovisit Thailand next weekfor meetings with regional leaders, a rare visit abroad for what hisspokesman describedas discussions with “potential for peace.”On Friday, with reports of extensive damage from the quake still coming in, a military spokesman appealed for international aid and said it would cooperate with foreign donors, an unusual step for a junta that has not asked for assistance in past disasters. The announcement suggested that the authorities expect the death toll to be high. Myanmar’s military government made an extraordinary plea for international assistance after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday, shaking a vast expanse of Southeast Asia and leaving destruction in its wake. The full extent of the toll was hard to assess in a country that has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. The ruling junta said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — not including Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, which lies near the epicenter. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000and could be much higher. In neighboring Thailand, at least seven people were killed and dozens were missing after a skyscraper under construction collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok. The appeal for international aid from Myanmar’s military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, was highly unusual for the junta, which is under heavy sanctions by the United States, Britain and others. Humanitarian groups said they were having difficulty assessing the damage because electricity and communication lines were down. The earthquake struck Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, around 12:50 p.m. local time. Bleeding victims were rushed to hospitals by ambulance, car and motorbike after the quake — the third of its magnitude to hit the region in the past century. Buildings were left in ruins, and a doctor at Mandalay General Hospital said so many people had arrived for treatment that nurses had run out of cotton swabs and he had no place to stand. Dozens of patients at the hospital — the main medical facility in the city, which has more than a million people — wereforced to flee to a nearby parking lot. Many were still hooked up to intravenous drips and oxygen tanks, some lying on cardboard or directly on the ground. Outside the hospital, Daw Kyi Shwin, 45, was bleeding heavily. She said that her 3-year-old daughter had been killed when their house began to collapse as they were having lunch. “I tried to run to her,” she said, “but before I could, bricks fell on me too.”Here’s what else to know: Humanitarian aid: Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability arelikely to complicate the global humanitarian aid responsedespite the rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. In a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Limited information: Myanmar’s junta has repeatedly shut off the internetand cut access to social media to thwart dissent and prop up its rule. That has cut the country off from the world digitally, and details of the destruction in many parts of Myanmar were not immediately available. Bridges and several buildings in Myanmar have collapsed, including in Naypyidaw, the capital, The Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-owned newspaper, reported. Chaos in Thailand: In Bangkok, more than 600 miles from Mandalay, videos showed water surging from pools atop high-rise hotels and residential towers. Videos verified by The New York Times showed thecollapse of a 30-story skyscraperthat was under construction as workers and passers-by ran for safety. At least seven people were reported killed in the collapse, and 20 people were stuck in an elevator, an official said, and it was unclear if they were still alive. Active quake zone: Myanmar is in one of the world’smost seismically active regions. Amagnitude 6.8 earthquakein eastern Myanmar killed more than 70 people and shattered hundreds of buildings in 2011. The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said an unspecified number of people had been injured in Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely to, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakePatients had to lie on cardboard or directly on the concrete outside the main hospital in Mandalay. Even before the earthquake, the health care system in Myanmar was under stress. In the parking lot of Mandalay General Hospital, dozens of patients — many with their heads and arms bandaged — were lined up on stretchers, or cardboard, in 100-degree heat. Many more lay directly on the concrete. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said Dr. Kyaw Zin, a surgeon at the hospital. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”He said the hospital was so jammed with injured people after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that “there is no space to stand.” Phone lines were down so he has not been able to contact his parents. “I’m very worried about my parents,” he added. “But I can’t go back home yet. I have to save lives here first.”Even before the quake, the health care system in Myanmar had been pushed to its limits. The military junta that has led the country since a 2021 coup has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has opposed the regime. Myanmar isone of the most dangerous places in the worldto be a health worker, according to New York-based Physicians for Human Rights. Dr. Kyaw Zin said that he was about to start surgery when the earthquake struck. Everybody, including patients, ran outside. On Friday afternoon, ambulance sirens shrieked. The injured kept coming. Nurses checked on patients in the parking lot, some of whom were hooked up to intravenous drips. People moaned for help. The smell of blood hung in the stifling heat. The junta said it did not have the full death toll. Damage to infrastructure could hinder access to regions that have already been struggling amid a bloody civil war. The epicenter of the earthquake, the Sagaing region, has been a focus of resistance to military rule. The World Health Organization said information was still hard to get because of aftershocks and disruptions to communications systems. The agency added that it was looking to send trauma supplies from its logistics hubs to support Myanmar. Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago, at a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Friday. Military rulers have been criticized for blocking delivery of international aid during past disasters, but this time the junta is already asking for help. Reporting from BangkokThe greatest damage caused by Friday’s 7.7 earthquake was in the region of central Myanmar controlled by the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago. The hardest hit areas included Naypyidaw, the regime’s capital, and Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, where structures collapsed and at least 20 people died. The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers search for survivors. Areas of the country that are controlled by rebel forces opposed to the junta are farther from the quake’s epicenter and appear to have come through largely unscathed, although reports of damage in remote areas may be slower to emerge. During past disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the country’s military rulers restricted the flow of international aid to hard-hit areas that were dominated by their political foes. But this time, the junta’s approach to recovery efforts may be different. Within hours of the quake, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing appealed for international aid and declared a state of emergency in six regions of the country, news agencies reported, including Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Two years ago, Cyclone Mocha swept through areas dominated by rebel forces and killed hundreds of people, including in Rakhine and Chin States. Days later,international aid providers complainedthat the junta was blocking the delivery of much needed aid. Similarly, when Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy Delta region in 2008, an earlier military government was widely criticized for its slow delivery of assistance. At the time, the United States accused that regime of“criminal neglect”in its handling of the disaster. Medical workers and supplies outside of a hospital in Napyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Since 2021, the ruling military junta has severely restricted the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country. After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday, the internet was filled with videos, images and social media posts documenting the damage in Thailand. But across the border in Myanmar, where the devastating quake was centered, there has been a far murkier picture about the scale of the diaster. Information from Myanmar has been harder to come by in part because of the country’s history of internet censorship. In recent years, the military has repeatedly shut off the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country from the rest of the world. The blocks have been intended to thwart dissent and prop up the country’s military rulers. Freedom of the press has also been severely restricted. But in an emergency like the earthquake, where power outages and infrastructure damage can already hinder access to the internet, such restrictions can further limit what information is available and can potentially affect the delivery of aid. Shortly after the quake, even the government struggled to stay online, as several official websites controlled by the junta were inaccessible. Myanmar’s military took power in a coup in 2021, seizing control of the country’s telecommunications networks, allowing it to shut down internet access in certain areas and create communications blackouts, according to Access Now, a digital rights organization. Despite widespread internet blocks, some areas have better connectivity than others. In regions where rebel groups have been fighting against the military, internet is particularly unreliable, with many using the satellite-based service Starlink to get online, said Joe Freeman, a Myanmar researcher at Amnesty International. The quake struck central Myanmar on Friday around 12:50 p.m. local time, causing damage in cities as far away as Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. The quake hit near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city after Yangon, and a strong aftershock was recorded shortly thereafter. Mr. Freeman said Myanmar’s internet blocks and censorship policies are surely having an effect on getting information about the extent of the disaster in the country. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Mr. Freeman said. The information black hole is a stark contrast to the reality of the country before the coup, when growing numbers of Facebook-addicted smartphone users posted huge amounts of memes, political debates and videos during previous crises, like the spread of Covid and protests against the military coup. A damaged roadway in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Central Myanmar, the scene of a powerful earthquake on Friday, lies near the eastern end of one of the world’s most active zones of seismic activity: the Alpide Belt, which extends from the Mediterranean Sea eastward through Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan, then along the Himalayas to Myanmar and finally Indonesia. The epicenter of the quake on Friday was near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city with more than a million people. While much of Myanmar is susceptible to earthquakes, Mandalay and the surrounding towns sit right on top of one of four places in the country that are particularly prone to unusually powerful quakes, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Program. The other three places are in much less populated parts of the country. Large plates of the Earth’s crust are in motion in Myanmar. These plates are slowly grinding together. Underground rocks can become stuck for many years, before lurching up, down or sideways in strong earthquakes like the one on Friday. The plate on which India sits is gradually moving north and crunching underneath western China. That plate movement is pushing up the Himalayas, the world’s tallest mountain range. But the eastern edge of the Indian Plate is also bumping under the Burma Platelet, which holds Myanmar. The Burma Platelet is also in motion because the floor of the Andaman Sea, which lies between India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, is slowly widening. The complex interaction of these plates produces many fault lines across central and northern Myanmar, many of which are poorly understood and some of which have not even been named by geologists. Powerful earthquakes occur because of the movement of large plates of the Earth’s crust across the magma underneath. The speed of these plates varies, but they generally move as fast as a person’s fingernails grow. Rescue workers at the scene of a construction site in Bangkok, where a building collapsed on Friday. A building in Bangkok that had been under construction collapsed, killing at least eight people, while dozens of workers remained stuck in the rubble. The 33-floor skyscraper shook, and then in a flash it crumbled, its glass facade cascading down into a heap of rubble. Construction workers on the site scurried for safety as a massive dust cloud billowed out. On the street outside, people ran for cover, some jumping into cars and speeding away. At the construction site, in northern Bangkok, at least eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing as of Friday evening, according to Anutin Charnvirakul, a deputy prime minister. They were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. About 70 people were taken to local hospitals. The rescue operation continued into the night as sniffer dogs searched for survivors. But the death toll was expected to rise. The nearby Chatuchak Park was being kept open through the night for people as a rest area, as were other parks — Benjakitti, Lumphini and Benjasiri. Traffic remained snarled hours after the earthquake hit and many people were unable to get home. Earlier in the day, throngs of panicked residents ran outside after Bangkok’s skyline swayed. Afterward, in central Bangkok, plazas and sidewalks were packed with crowds of office workers, shopkeepers and tourists who remained outside for fear of aftershocks and structural damage to the buildings. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand declared Bangkok an “area of emergency,” asking residents to evacuate from tall buildings in case of aftershocks. Other videos showed water sloshing out of therooftop swimming poolof a high-rise hotel and spilling down the side of the building. The city’s elevated train, known as the Skytrain, was shut down and traffic on the city’s major arteries came to a virtual standstill as people tried to return home. Office towers, shopping malls and hotels evacuated their employees and guests while they conducted inspections to determine whether there had been damage before allowing them back inside. Pam Kershaw and her husband, tourists from Melbourne, Australia, were in their room on the 25th floor of the Athenee Hotel when the earthquake struck. The room began swaying and pictures banged against the walls. “It was very scary,” she said as she sat outside the hotel with hundreds of others waiting to go back inside. Sui-Lee Weecontributed reporting from Bangkok. Workers carrying an injured person near the site of the collapsed building. Chinesestate media reportedthat an unspecified number of people were injured and houses damaged in Ruili, a city in Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar. Ina videofrom Ruili shared by state media, a cloud of dust billowed from a tall building as people ran down the street away from it. Other videos shared widely online showed rubble in the streets. A Ruili residenttoldChinese official media that he had been riding his bicycle, when buildings and trees along the road began shaking. The resident, identified as Mr. Zhang, said that the beams of his home had cracked, and that the garages of some shopping malls had collapsed. Other videos showed light fixtures shaking in an apartment in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, nearly 500 miles away. China’s National Earthquake Data Centerwroteon social media that tremors were also felt in Guizhou and Guangxi, regions that do not border Myanmar. The aftershock that struck about 11 minutes after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake was stronger than initially thought. The U.S. Geological Survey, which originally reported that the aftershock’s magnitude was 6.4, has raised the level to 6.7. President Trump said Friday that the United States would provide assistance to Myanmar following the deadly earthquakes. “It’s a real bad one, and we will be helping,” he said in the Oval Office. “We’ve already spoken with the country”Emergency personnel continued to work after sundown at the scene of a collapsed building in northern Bangkok, where dozens were still missing. The United Nations said it had allocated an initial $5 million from its emergency fund to help life-saving operations in Myanmar and other areas impacted by the earthquake. Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the organization was gathering information to better guide its response and direct resources. He said the earthquake had worsened “an already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar, where nearly 20 million people need assistance across the country, including more than 3.5 million displaced from their homes.”The Myanmar military’s death toll of 144 is only from the three cities of Sagaing, Kyaukse, and Naypyidaw, suggesting that the total scaleislikely to be higher. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake toppled century-old stupas in a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, Shan State, just 70 miles from the epicenter. “Pindaya felt some earthquakes before but not so strong like today’s,” the monastery’s Facebook page administrator said by email, adding, “Most stupas are old ones and believed to be over 100 years old.”The photographs showed elaborate golden spires smashed on the ground, and red bricks strewn around the site. The foundations of other monuments and buildings were badly cracked. The earthquake severely damaged a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, in Myanmar’s Shan State, about 70 miles from the epicenter. Several century-old stupas that adorned the religious site were toppled, photos obtained by The New York Times showed. And a witness video, geolocated by The Times to a street beside the monastery, captured the collapse of the largest of the golden stupas during an aftershock. Women wailed at the sight, as young Buddhist students exited the complex through a side gate. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said the U.N. system was mobilizing to help the people in need. In Mandalay, as the night deepened, terrified residents dragged their mattresses and mosquito nets out to the streets to sleep. Some planned to spend the night in their cars. Many were too scared to return to their homes. The population in the stricken region “resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,” the report said, adding that “recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as landslides.”The U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks seismic activity around the world, warned ina reporton Friday: “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread.”Outside Mandalay General Hospital, patients keep streaming in. An ambulance siren wails, even after it stops to deliver a victim into the parking lot of the overwhelmed hospital. In Bangkok, at least seven people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing at a building that collapsed, as of Friday evening, according to the authorities. The military government in Myanmar said 144 people were dead and 732 injured. The agency warned that “the impact of the earthquake in Myanmar is likely to be severe, with possibly thousands of displaced people in need of urgent shelter, food and medical aid.” “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” the group said. The International Rescue Committee says local media have reported at least 80 people were killed in Myanmar. One rescue worker in the city of Mandalay, Tun Min Latt, said the death toll had reached 86, with 60 those in Mandalay alone. The World Health Organization says it is looking at sending trauma supplies from its logistic hubs to support Myanmar. Myanmar has declared a state of emergency in six regions: Sagaing, Mandalay, Naypyidaw, Bago, Magway and Northeastern Shan State, according to Gen. Zaw Min Tun. In Bangkok, at the site of a building that had collapsed, an official told reporters that 70 people were still missing. A further 20 people were trapped in an elevator shaft, and it was unclear if they were alive. Outside the overwhelmed Mandalay General Hospital, there was chaos. Injured victims lay on stretchers, with their heads bandaged, moaning from the pain. There was a pool of blood. An ambulance siren wailed. When the vehicle stopped, two men carried a male victim down. General Zaw Min Tun said the government did not know the total number of casualties yet but that it was doing all it could to help the victims. The junta’s appeal for aid to the international community is extremely rare. In previous natural disasters, it has almost never asked for humanitarian aid. The call suggests that the authorities expect the death toll to be large. The Myanmar military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, said, “we need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid.” He added, “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”The structure that collapsed was constructed in 2015, historical satellite imagery shows. Times journalists reported from the monastery in 2019; it was once attended by the infamous monk, Ashin Wirathu, who was jailed for hate speech directed against the Rohingya in Myanmar. In a striking Facebook video verified by The Times, Buddhist monks at the New Masoeyein monastery in Mandalay survey the remains of an ornate clock tower toppled by the powerful quake. As they look on, the multistory monastery building collapses before them. The head of Myanmar’s military junta, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, visited a 1,000-bed hospital in Naypyidaw, the country’s capital, after the earthquake. Dr. Kyaw Zin said there were so many injured people in the hospital that he had no space to set foot. Dr. Kyaw Zin, a doctor at the Mandalay General Hospital, said the death toll is now at 20, with at least 300 injured. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” he said. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”The number of injured in Myanmar is expected to rise. By late afternoon, more victims started turning up at the Mandalay General Hospital, arriving by ambulance, car and motorbike. Many of them were bleeding heavily."

What We Know About the Earthquake in MyanmarThe death toll in Myanmar has exceeded 1,600, the country’s military government said. The powerful earthquake also jolted other parts of Southeast Asia. A 7.7-magnitude earthquakestruck central Myanmaron Friday, sending shock waves across other parts of Southeast Asia and China and leaving a trail of death and destruction. The death toll exceeded 1,600 and more than 3,400 people were injured, the country’s military government said Saturday, and those numbers were expected to rise. Hundreds of miles from the epicenter, the earthquake caused the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, killing at least nine people and leaving dozens of others missing. In Photos and VideosMyanmar is in the throes of a civil war that has left nearly 20 million people without proper food and shelter. Censorshipimposed by its military governmenthas limited the spread of information from the heart of the disaster, even as the scale of damage in Thailand and other countries has slowly become clearer. Where was the epicenter? The quake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, at roughly 12:50 p.m. local time, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Approximately 11 minutes later, an aftershock hit the same area. Central Myanmar, where large plates of the Earth’s crust are in motion, isprone to powerful earthquakes. The country lies on the eastern end of the Alpide Belt, one of the world’s most active seismic zones. Three quakes of magnitude 7.7 or greater have struck in or near Myanmar in the last century, according to a U.S.G.S. database, with the most recent in 1988. The earthquake on Friday struck at a relatively shallow depth of six miles, meaning it was likely to cause more violent shaking. It devastated areas near theSagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar. Which countries have been affected? Despite the limited information from the authorities in Myanmar, the earthquake was almost certainly most destructive there. The city of Mandalay, the largest major city near the epicenter, has anestimated populationof 1.5 million. Strong tremors were also felt in neighboring Thailand, particularly in Bangkok, wherearound 11 million peoplelive in the metropolitan area. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra declared the city an “area of emergency,” asking residents to evacuate from tall buildings to avoid aftershocks. In China, news media outlets in Yunnan Province, which neighbors Myanmar, reported damage to buildings in the busy border city of Ruili. The shaking was also felt in Bangladesh, to Myanmar’s west, but there were no immediate reports of damage. What is the death toll, and what damage has been caused? Myanmar’s military government said on Saturday that 1,644 people had been killed by the quake, with 3,408 others injured. The full extent of the toll was hard to assess in a country that facesheavy censorshipenforced by Myanmar’s military government and has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. The number of deaths was expected to rise as rescue workers dug through the rubble and injured people made their way to hospitals. Modeling by the U.S.G.S. estimated that the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Outside an overwhelmed hospital in Mandalay on Friday. In Mandalay, video showed that the Ava Bridge, originally built by the British in the 1930s, had partly collapsed, according to footage verified by The New York Times. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’shistoric and religious sites, reducing centuries-old monuments to rubble. In Thailand,at least nine people diedand scores more were feared buried under the rubble after a high-rise building that had been under constructioncollapsed in Bangkok. The city’s elevated train service was shut down in the wake of the tremor and people fled from tall buildings after the city was placed in a state of emergency. What aid is Myanmar receiving? The areas worst hit are in the center of Myanmar, which is controlled by the military junta. When disasters have struck in the past, like Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the military government avoided asking for international assistance and throttled aid in areas not under its control.

China and India sent food and blankets for survivors, as well as rescue teams equipped with drones and other tools to help with the search effort.

Military rulers have been criticized for blocking delivery of international aid during past disasters, but this time the junta is already asking for help. Reporting from BangkokThe greatest damage caused by Friday’s 7.7 earthquake was in the region of central Myanmar controlled by the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago. The hardest hit areas included Naypyidaw, the regime’s capital, and Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, where structures collapsed and at least 20 people died. The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers search for survivors. Areas of the country that are controlled by rebel forces opposed to the junta are farther from the quake’s epicenter and appear to have come through largely unscathed, although reports of damage in remote areas may be slower to emerge. During past disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the country’s military rulers restricted the flow of international aid to hard-hit areas that were dominated by their political foes. But this time, the junta’s approach to recovery efforts may be different. Within hours of the quake, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing appealed for international aid and declared a state of emergency in six regions of the country, news agencies reported, including Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Two years ago, Cyclone Mocha swept through areas dominated by rebel forces and killed hundreds of people, including in Rakhine and Chin States. Days later,international aid providers complainedthat the junta was blocking the delivery of much needed aid. Similarly, when Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy Delta region in 2008, an earlier military government was widely criticized for its slow delivery of assistance. At the time, the United States accused that regime of“criminal neglect”in its handling of the disaster. Myanmar’s military government made an extraordinary plea for international assistance after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday, shaking a vast expanse of Southeast Asia and leaving destruction in its wake. The full extent of the toll was hard to assess in a country that has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. The ruling junta said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — not including Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, which lies near the epicenter. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000and could be much higher. In neighboring Thailand, at least seven people were killed and dozens were missing after a skyscraper under construction collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok. The appeal for international aid from Myanmar’s military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, was highly unusual for the junta, which is under heavy sanctions by the United States, Britain and others. Humanitarian groups said they were having difficulty assessing the damage because electricity and communication lines were down. The earthquake struck Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, around 12:50 p.m. local time. Bleeding victims were rushed to hospitals by ambulance, car and motorbike after the quake — the third of its magnitude to hit the region in the past century. Buildings were left in ruins, and a doctor at Mandalay General Hospital said so many people had arrived for treatment that nurses had run out of cotton swabs and he had no place to stand. Dozens of patients at the hospital — the main medical facility in the city, which has more than a million people — wereforced to flee to a nearby parking lot. Many were still hooked up to intravenous drips and oxygen tanks, some lying on cardboard or directly on the ground. Outside the hospital, Daw Kyi Shwin, 45, was bleeding heavily. She said that her 3-year-old daughter had been killed when their house began to collapse as they were having lunch. “I tried to run to her,” she said, “but before I could, bricks fell on me too.”Here’s what else to know: Humanitarian aid: Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability arelikely to complicate the global humanitarian aid responsedespite the rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. In a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Limited information: Myanmar’s junta has repeatedly shut off the internetand cut access to social media to thwart dissent and prop up its rule. That has cut the country off from the world digitally, and details of the destruction in many parts of Myanmar were not immediately available. Bridges and several buildings in Myanmar have collapsed, including in Naypyidaw, the capital, The Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-owned newspaper, reported. Chaos in Thailand: In Bangkok, more than 600 miles from Mandalay, videos showed water surging from pools atop high-rise hotels and residential towers. Videos verified by The New York Times showed thecollapse of a 30-story skyscraperthat was under construction as workers and passers-by ran for safety. At least seven people were reported killed in the collapse, and 20 people were stuck in an elevator, an official said, and it was unclear if they were still alive. Active quake zone: Myanmar is in one of the world’smost seismically active regions. Amagnitude 6.8 earthquakein eastern Myanmar killed more than 70 people and shattered hundreds of buildings in 2011.

Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely to, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakePatients had to lie on cardboard or directly on the concrete outside the main hospital in Mandalay. Even before the earthquake, the health care system in Myanmar was under stress. In the parking lot of Mandalay General Hospital, dozens of patients — many with their heads and arms bandaged — were lined up on stretchers, or cardboard, in 100-degree heat. Many more lay directly on the concrete. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said Dr. Kyaw Zin, a surgeon at the hospital. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”He said the hospital was so jammed with injured people after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that “there is no space to stand.” Phone lines were down so he has not been able to contact his parents. “I’m very worried about my parents,” he added. “But I can’t go back home yet. I have to save lives here first.”Even before the quake, the health care system in Myanmar had been pushed to its limits. The military junta that has led the country since a 2021 coup has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has opposed the regime. Myanmar isone of the most dangerous places in the worldto be a health worker, according to New York-based Physicians for Human Rights. Dr. Kyaw Zin said that he was about to start surgery when the earthquake struck. Everybody, including patients, ran outside. On Friday afternoon, ambulance sirens shrieked. The injured kept coming. Nurses checked on patients in the parking lot, some of whom were hooked up to intravenous drips. People moaned for help. The smell of blood hung in the stifling heat. The junta said it did not have the full death toll. Damage to infrastructure could hinder access to regions that have already been struggling amid a bloody civil war. The epicenter of the earthquake, the Sagaing region, has been a focus of resistance to military rule. The World Health Organization said information was still hard to get because of aftershocks and disruptions to communications systems. The agency added that it was looking to send trauma supplies from its logistics hubs to support Myanmar.

Since seizing power four years ago, the military junta that controls Myanmar has gradually become so weakened that some analysts have predicted it could soon collapse, in a scenario similar to the rebel overthrow of Syria’s government in December. With the financial and military backing of benefactors — including China, India, Russia and Thailand — the junta has managed to maintain its grip. It controls about 20 percent of the territory, mainly urban areas, amid a civil war that had left nearly 20 million people without sufficient food, shelter or security even before Friday’s earthquake, according to a report this week by the United Nations humanitarian aid agency. Myanmar’sbleak economyhas stirred widespread anger against the junta, which has grappled withhigh levels of defections. Its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing,has been accusedof crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. General Min Aung Hlaing has kept up persecution of ethnic minorities, including this montharresting the leaderof an armed group that has sought to protect Rohingya Muslims from ascorched-earth campaignof arson, mass rape and killing that the United Stateshas called genocide. The Trump administration so far has taken a largely hands-off approach to Myanmar, although in January itjoined an allianceof democratic countries condemning the junta and urging it to de-escalate violence. The move aims to contain Myanmar’s instability and prevent another surge of people fleeing the country, after about one million Rohingya have already escaped to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. But India, Russia and China all have provided weapons to the junta, and Thailand has given it financial support and defended it against international condemnation,according to an analysisby the Council on Foreign Relations. China, which has sold jets, drones, artillery and electromagnetic jammers to help the junta battle rebels, sees the military-led government as the only force that can hold Myanmar together. But Beijing has hesitated to fully endorse the February 2021 coup and appears to be looking for what theStimson Center, a foreign policy research group, described this month as an “off-ramp” for the junta. Last year, China pledged $3 billion in assistance to the junta, in part to finance a census and some semblance of elections. But the Stimson Center’s report said that “Beijing seems unconvinced that a transition to a federal democratic system is possible.”General Min Aung Hlaing’s recent moves indicate that he is trying at least to be seen as responsive to international pressure. On Thursday, he announced that Myanmar would hold “dignified” elections in December. He is reportedly planning tovisit Thailand next weekfor meetings with regional leaders, a rare visit abroad for what hisspokesman describedas discussions with “potential for peace.”On Friday, with reports of extensive damage from the quake still coming in, a military spokesman appealed for international aid and said it would cooperate with foreign donors, an unusual step for a junta that has not asked for assistance in past disasters. The announcement suggested that the authorities expect the death toll to be high. Medical workers and supplies outside of a hospital in Napyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Since 2021, the ruling military junta has severely restricted the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country. After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday, the internet was filled with videos, images and social media posts documenting the damage in Thailand. But across the border in Myanmar, where the devastating quake was centered, there has been a far murkier picture about the scale of the diaster. Information from Myanmar has been harder to come by in part because of the country’s history of internet censorship. In recent years, the military has repeatedly shut off the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country from the rest of the world. The blocks have been intended to thwart dissent and prop up the country’s military rulers. Freedom of the press has also been severely restricted. But in an emergency like the earthquake, where power outages and infrastructure damage can already hinder access to the internet, such restrictions can further limit what information is available and can potentially affect the delivery of aid. Shortly after the quake, even the government struggled to stay online, as several official websites controlled by the junta were inaccessible. Myanmar’s military took power in a coup in 2021, seizing control of the country’s telecommunications networks, allowing it to shut down internet access in certain areas and create communications blackouts, according to Access Now, a digital rights organization. Despite widespread internet blocks, some areas have better connectivity than others. In regions where rebel groups have been fighting against the military, internet is particularly unreliable, with many using the satellite-based service Starlink to get online, said Joe Freeman, a Myanmar researcher at Amnesty International. The quake struck central Myanmar on Friday around 12:50 p.m. local time, causing damage in cities as far away as Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. The quake hit near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city after Yangon, and a strong aftershock was recorded shortly thereafter. Mr. Freeman said Myanmar’s internet blocks and censorship policies are surely having an effect on getting information about the extent of the disaster in the country. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Mr. Freeman said. The information black hole is a stark contrast to the reality of the country before the coup, when growing numbers of Facebook-addicted smartphone users posted huge amounts of memes, political debates and videos during previous crises, like the spread of Covid and protests against the military coup. A damaged roadway in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Central Myanmar, the scene of a powerful earthquake on Friday, lies near the eastern end of one of the world’s most active zones of seismic activity: the Alpide Belt, which extends from the Mediterranean Sea eastward through Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan, then along the Himalayas to Myanmar and finally Indonesia. The epicenter of the quake on Friday was near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city with more than a million people. While much of Myanmar is susceptible to earthquakes, Mandalay and the surrounding towns sit right on top of one of four places in the country that are particularly prone to unusually powerful quakes, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Program. The other three places are in much less populated parts of the country. Large plates of the Earth’s crust are in motion in Myanmar. These plates are slowly grinding together. Underground rocks can become stuck for many years, before lurching up, down or sideways in strong earthquakes like the one on Friday. The plate on which India sits is gradually moving north and crunching underneath western China. That plate movement is pushing up the Himalayas, the world’s tallest mountain range. But the eastern edge of the Indian Plate is also bumping under the Burma Platelet, which holds Myanmar. The Burma Platelet is also in motion because the floor of the Andaman Sea, which lies between India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, is slowly widening. The complex interaction of these plates produces many fault lines across central and northern Myanmar, many of which are poorly understood and some of which have not even been named by geologists. Powerful earthquakes occur because of the movement of large plates of the Earth’s crust across the magma underneath. The speed of these plates varies, but they generally move as fast as a person’s fingernails grow. Rescue workers at the scene of a construction site in Bangkok, where a building collapsed on Friday. A building in Bangkok that had been under construction collapsed, killing at least eight people, while dozens of workers remained stuck in the rubble. The 33-floor skyscraper shook, and then in a flash it crumbled, its glass facade cascading down into a heap of rubble. Construction workers on the site scurried for safety as a massive dust cloud billowed out. On the street outside, people ran for cover, some jumping into cars and speeding away. At the construction site, in northern Bangkok, at least eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing as of Friday evening, according to Anutin Charnvirakul, a deputy prime minister. They were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. About 70 people were taken to local hospitals. The rescue operation continued into the night as sniffer dogs searched for survivors. But the death toll was expected to rise. The nearby Chatuchak Park was being kept open through the night for people as a rest area, as were other parks — Benjakitti, Lumphini and Benjasiri. Traffic remained snarled hours after the earthquake hit and many people were unable to get home. Earlier in the day, throngs of panicked residents ran outside after Bangkok’s skyline swayed. Afterward, in central Bangkok, plazas and sidewalks were packed with crowds of office workers, shopkeepers and tourists who remained outside for fear of aftershocks and structural damage to the buildings. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand declared Bangkok an “area of emergency,” asking residents to evacuate from tall buildings in case of aftershocks. Other videos showed water sloshing out of therooftop swimming poolof a high-rise hotel and spilling down the side of the building. The city’s elevated train, known as the Skytrain, was shut down and traffic on the city’s major arteries came to a virtual standstill as people tried to return home. Office towers, shopping malls and hotels evacuated their employees and guests while they conducted inspections to determine whether there had been damage before allowing them back inside. Pam Kershaw and her husband, tourists from Melbourne, Australia, were in their room on the 25th floor of the Athenee Hotel when the earthquake struck. The room began swaying and pictures banged against the walls. “It was very scary,” she said as she sat outside the hotel with hundreds of others waiting to go back inside.

A Ruili residenttoldChinese official media that he had been riding his bicycle, when buildings and trees along the road began shaking. The resident, identified as Mr. Zhang, said that the beams of his home had cracked, and that the garages of some shopping malls had collapsed. Other videos showed light fixtures shaking in an apartment in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, nearly 500 miles away. China’s National Earthquake Data Centerwroteon social media that tremors were also felt in Guizhou and Guangxi, regions that do not border Myanmar. The aftershock that struck about 11 minutes after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake was stronger than initially thought. The U.S. Geological Survey, which originally reported that the aftershock’s magnitude was 6.4, has raised the level to 6.7. President Trump said Friday that the United States would provide assistance to Myanmar following the deadly earthquakes. “It’s a real bad one, and we will be helping,” he said in the Oval Office. “We’ve already spoken with the country”Emergency personnel continued to work after sundown at the scene of a collapsed building in northern Bangkok, where dozens were still missing. The United Nations said it had allocated an initial $5 million from its emergency fund to help life-saving operations in Myanmar and other areas impacted by the earthquake. Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the organization was gathering information to better guide its response and direct resources. He said the earthquake had worsened “an already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar, where nearly 20 million people need assistance across the country, including more than 3.5 million displaced from their homes.”The Myanmar military’s death toll of 144 is only from the three cities of Sagaing, Kyaukse, and Naypyidaw, suggesting that the total scaleislikely to be higher. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake toppled century-old stupas in a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, Shan State, just 70 miles from the epicenter. “Pindaya felt some earthquakes before but not so strong like today’s,” the monastery’s Facebook page administrator said by email, adding, “Most stupas are old ones and believed to be over 100 years old.”The photographs showed elaborate golden spires smashed on the ground, and red bricks strewn around the site. The foundations of other monuments and buildings were badly cracked. The earthquake severely damaged a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, in Myanmar’s Shan State, about 70 miles from the epicenter. Several century-old stupas that adorned the religious site were toppled, photos obtained by The New York Times showed. And a witness video, geolocated by The Times to a street beside the monastery, captured the collapse of the largest of the golden stupas during an aftershock. Women wailed at the sight, as young Buddhist students exited the complex through a side gate. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said the U.N. system was mobilizing to help the people in need. In Mandalay, as the night deepened, terrified residents dragged their mattresses and mosquito nets out to the streets to sleep. Some planned to spend the night in their cars. Many were too scared to return to their homes. The population in the stricken region “resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,” the report said, adding that “recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as landslides.”The U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks seismic activity around the world, warned ina reporton Friday: “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread.”Outside Mandalay General Hospital, patients keep streaming in. An ambulance siren wails, even after it stops to deliver a victim into the parking lot of the overwhelmed hospital. In Bangkok, at least seven people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing at a building that collapsed, as of Friday evening, according to the authorities. The military government in Myanmar said 144 people were dead and 732 injured. The agency warned that “the impact of the earthquake in Myanmar is likely to be severe, with possibly thousands of displaced people in need of urgent shelter, food and medical aid.” “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” the group said. The International Rescue Committee says local media have reported at least 80 people were killed in Myanmar. One rescue worker in the city of Mandalay, Tun Min Latt, said the death toll had reached 86, with 60 those in Mandalay alone. The World Health Organization says it is looking at sending trauma supplies from its logistic hubs to support Myanmar. Myanmar has declared a state of emergency in six regions: Sagaing, Mandalay, Naypyidaw, Bago, Magway and Northeastern Shan State, according to Gen. Zaw Min Tun. In Bangkok, at the site of a building that had collapsed, an official told reporters that 70 people were still missing. A further 20 people were trapped in an elevator shaft, and it was unclear if they were alive. Outside the overwhelmed Mandalay General Hospital, there was chaos. Injured victims lay on stretchers, with their heads bandaged, moaning from the pain. There was a pool of blood. An ambulance siren wailed. When the vehicle stopped, two men carried a male victim down. General Zaw Min Tun said the government did not know the total number of casualties yet but that it was doing all it could to help the victims. The junta’s appeal for aid to the international community is extremely rare. In previous natural disasters, it has almost never asked for humanitarian aid. The call suggests that the authorities expect the death toll to be large. The Myanmar military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, said, “we need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid.” He added, “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”The structure that collapsed was constructed in 2015, historical satellite imagery shows. Times journalists reported from the monastery in 2019; it was once attended by the infamous monk, Ashin Wirathu, who was jailed for hate speech directed against the Rohingya in Myanmar. In a striking Facebook video verified by The Times, Buddhist monks at the New Masoeyein monastery in Mandalay survey the remains of an ornate clock tower toppled by the powerful quake. As they look on, the multistory monastery building collapses before them. The head of Myanmar’s military junta, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, visited a 1,000-bed hospital in Naypyidaw, the country’s capital, after the earthquake. Dr. Kyaw Zin said there were so many injured people in the hospital that he had no space to set foot. Dr. Kyaw Zin, a doctor at the Mandalay General Hospital, said the death toll is now at 20, with at least 300 injured. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” he said. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”The number of injured in Myanmar is expected to rise. By late afternoon, more victims started turning up at the Mandalay General Hospital, arriving by ambulance, car and motorbike. Many of them were bleeding heavily."

At least 2,700 people were killed and many more injured. With the full extent of the disaster still emerging, those numbers are likely to rise. The 7.7-magnitude quake struck just before 1 p.m. local time, and a strong, 6.4-magnitude aftershock followed 11 minutes later. The shaking was felt in southern China and Vietnam and as far away as Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, where a tall building under construction collapsed.

Euan Ward reported from Beirut, Lebanon, and Aaron Boxerman from Jerusalem. Israel Launches Airstrikes Near Beirut for First Time Since Cease-FireThe attack in the southern outskirts of the Lebanese capital, an area where Hezbollah holds sway, followed rocket fire toward northern Israel. The Israeli military launched airstrikes in the southern outskirts of Beirut on Friday for the first time since a U.S.-brokered cease-fire came into effect in November, shattering months of tense calm in the Lebanese capital and stoking fears of a further escalation. The bombardment came after rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanese territory earlier in the day, setting off air-raid sirens in three communities near the border. The Israeli military subsequently ordered residents of the densely populated Hadath neighborhood of Dahiya, an area on the southern edges of Beirut, to evacuate from the vicinity of a building there. Less than two hours later, the airstrikes began. The Israeli military said it had targeted a site that stored Hezbollah’s drones, but did not explicitly blame the Lebanese militant group for the rocket fire earlier in the day. Hezbollah denied any involvement in the attack on Israel and said it remained committed to the cease-fire. But this was the second such exchange of fire in less than a week, prompting fears that the truce between Israel and Hezbollah could unravel. At least three people were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Friday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The Lebanese military said it was investigating who had fired the rockets. Hezbollah, which is struggling to recover from the devastating 14-month conflict with Israel, has little desire to risk reigniting a conflict, according to experts. But Palestinian armed groups like Hamas also maintain a sizable presence in Lebanon, operating mostly from decades-old refugee camps. During the war in Gaza, these groups have intermittently launched rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel. After the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack ignited the war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets and drones at Israeli positions in solidarity with its Palestinian ally. After nearly a year of low-level violence, the fighting escalated into full-scale war and an Israeli ground invasion before the two sidesagreed to a cease-fire. It marked Lebanon’s deadliest andmost destructiveconflict since the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. The Israeli strike stirred fear and pandemonium in parts of the capital, Beirut. Despite the truce, Israeli forces have regularly attacked in southern and eastern Lebanon, leading Hezbollah to accuse Israel of breaking the cease-fire. But Dahiya, which is traditionally a bastion of support for Hezbollah, had not been targeted since the cease-fire went into effect. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said that the country was determined to “strongly enforce” the cease-fire, which obligated the Lebanese government to prevent militant groups from attacking Israel from its territory. “The equation has changed,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “We will not allow firing at our communities — not even a trickle.”After the Israeli military issued the evacuation warnings, surveillance drones began to whir above Beirut and gunfire erupted in the Dahiya as residents attempted to alert neighbors to an imminent Israeli strike. The Lebanese authorities also ordered all schools in the area to close, and parents rushed to collect screaming children. Students who spoke to The New York Times reported being ordered by teachers to move away from the windows, and said their classmates broke down in fear. The pandemonium was reminiscent of the most intense days of the war, when Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut’s southern outskirts on a near daily basis. “People are panicking,” said Elie Hachem, the director of the St. Therese hospital, about 600 meters from the targeted building. “I can hear cars honking like crazy outside on the street.”The hospital, which had beenbadly damaged in the war, was left unscathed by the strike, but casualties soon began arriving into the emergency room, said Mr. Hachem. Residents of the southern outskirts of Beirut rushed to take cover after an Israeli airstrike. Air-raid sirens warning of incoming rocket fire had rung out earlier on Friday in northern Israel, including in the city of Kiryat Shmona. The Israeli military later said one of the projectiles was intercepted and another fell inside Lebanese territory. Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, ordered the country’s security forces to arrest those responsible for the rocket fire, calling it “irresponsible” and a threat to “Lebanon’s stability and security,” according to a statement. The Lebanese government is distinct from Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political party that wielded enormous influence in Lebanon before the war. The new government has pledged to bring all weapons under the state’s control — including Hezbollah’s — but it remains unclear exactly when and how they will do that. The U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, called for restraint, warning that a “a return to wider conflict in Lebanon would be devastating.”Hwaida SaadandDayana Iwazacontributed reporting from Beirut.

Myanmar’s Internet Censorship Limits Information About Quake,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-internet-censorship.html,2025-03-28T11:08:18Z,World,"Since 2021, the ruling military junta has severely restricted the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country.",Earthquakes; Social Media; Communications and Media Blackouts; Computers and the Internet; Censorship,,,,"Medical workers and supplies outside of a hospital in Napyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Myanmar’s Internet Censorship Limits Information About QuakeSince 2021, the ruling military junta has severely restricted the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country. After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday, the internet was filled with videos, images and social media posts documenting the damage in Thailand. But across the border in Myanmar, where the devastating quake was centered, there has been a far murkier picture about the scale of the diaster. Information from Myanmar has been harder to come by in part because of the country’s history of internet censorship. In recent years, the military has repeatedly shut off the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country from the rest of the world. The blocks have been intended to thwart dissent and prop up the country’s military rulers. Freedom of the press has also been severely restricted. But in an emergency like the earthquake, where power outages and infrastructure damage can already hinder access to the internet, such restrictions can further limit what information is available and can potentially affect the delivery of aid. Shortly after the quake, even the government struggled to stay online, as several official websites controlled by the junta were inaccessible. Myanmar’s military took power in a coup in 2021, seizing control of the country’s telecommunications networks, allowing it to shut down internet access in certain areas and create communications blackouts, according to Access Now, a digital rights organization. Despite widespread internet blocks, some areas have better connectivity than others. In regions where rebel groups have been fighting against the military, internet is particularly unreliable, with many using the satellite-based service Starlink to get online, said Joe Freeman, a Myanmar researcher at Amnesty International. The quake struck central Myanmar on Friday around 12:50 p.m. local time, causing damage in cities as far away as Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. The quake hit near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city after Yangon, and a strong aftershock was recorded shortly thereafter. Mr. Freeman said Myanmar’s internet blocks and censorship policies are surely having an effect on getting information about the extent of the disaster in the country. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Mr. Freeman said. The information black hole is a stark contrast to the reality of the country before the coup, when growing numbers of Facebook-addicted smartphone users posted huge amounts of memes, political debates and videos during previous crises, like the spread of Covid and protests against the military coup.

"Medieval Tales of Merlin and Arthur, Hidden for Centuries, Return to Light",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/merlin-manuscript-cambridge.html,2025-03-28T10:54:16Z,World,Cambridge University researchers found a manuscript with rare Arthurian tales bound into a ledger more than 400 years old and used advanced technology to reveal its contents.,Manuscripts; Middle Ages (Historical Period); Myths and Mythical Creatures,,Cambridge (England),Cambridge University,"Modern-day magic was used to rescue this old manuscript about Merlin. Medieval Tales of Merlin and Arthur, Hidden for Centuries, Return to LightCambridge University researchers found a manuscript with rare Arthurian tales bound into a ledger more than 400 years old and used advanced technology to reveal its contents. Torn, folded and stitched, rare tales of Merlin shapeshifting into King Arthur’s court and Sir Gawain gaining power from the sun were bound into a book of property records from the 1500s. They went unnoticed for centuries, stacked among the records of an English manor and then among the millions of volumes of a university library. At least until an archivist took another look, setting off a yearslong project to identify and then reassemble the medieval manuscript, which someone in Tudor England had taken apart and used to help hold together a ledger. The manuscript turned out to be a priceless find: extremely rare stories of Arthurian romance, copied by a scribe between 1275 and 1315, and part of the “Suite Vulgate du Merlin,” an Old French sequel to the start of the Arthur legend. Cambridge University researchers announced their findings this week andpublished a digitized versionof the manuscript online. There are fewer than 40 copies of the Suite Vulgate sequel known to exist, and no two are exactly the same. “Each manuscript copy of a medieval text, handwritten by a scribe, is going to be changed little by little,” said Irène Fabry-Tehranchi, the French specialist at the university library. “As the copies come along, each scribe imposes his own taste.”The manuscript tells two stories. The first is about Sir Gawain, nephew of King Arthur, whose rivals include both rebellious barons at home and pagan Saxons invading from abroad. Among the intransigent nobles is Gawain’s own father, and Gawain sides with Arthur to defeat him. Then it’s on to the Saxons. Wielding Excalibur, the sword of myth, Gawain grows more powerful as the sun rises, reaching peak strength at midday. His victory for Arthur’s side is no less satisfying for being predictable. In the second episode, Arthur and his queen, Guinevere, are presiding over a feast when it is interrupted by a mysterious visitor, a blind harpist, guided into court by a white dog. Charmed by his music, Arthur agrees to the strange man’s even stranger request: to bear the king’s standard on the battlefield — a seemingly fatal wish. The harpist is Merlin, disguised, though the members of court realize this only long afterward. “The standard, thanks to Merlin’s magic, can become this magical dragon who blows fire on the battlefield,” Dr. Fabry-Tehranchi said. At the time of its creation, the manuscript was “a luxury item,” she added, most likely imported to England by aristocrats familiar with Old French as the Arthurian romances grew in popularity. But as the stories were translated into English, the value of such manuscripts fell. Unless one had a bunch of deeds or the like lying around and in need of a little binding. That may explain how someone at Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk in the 16th century settled on the old parchment as a bit of raw material to strengthen a ledger. The manor’s collection came to Cambridge in the 1970s, but it was only in 2019 that an archivist realized that the hidden manuscript deserved a closer look. The painstaking process wound up taking years, given that the fragile manuscript had been recycled inside a book that was itself centuries old. “We really needed to go into the nooks and crannies of this object,” Dr. Fabry-Tehranchi said. Researchers used multispectral imaging, which relies on different wavelengths of light like ultraviolet and infrared, to reveal details in the manuscript that the naked eye could not spot. With help from their colleagues in the zoology department, they also employed a CT scanner usually used for fossils to uncover the parchment’s layers without physically dismantling the book. Under sophisticated imaging techniques, the old manuscript gradually gave up its secrets. The restorers also used mirrors, magnets, prisms and other tools to take hundreds of photographs of parts of the manuscript that were hidden under folds or stitched into the binding. The result was a sort of medieval, Old French jigsaw puzzle that had to be assembled into a legible text. “This project is fabulous primarily for its use of new technology to recover the material culture of the past, which may survive physically but remain inaccessible for a variety of reasons,” said Hannah Weaver, a professor of medieval literature at Columbia University, who was not involved in the work. It was not just the innovative use of imaging, Dr. Weaver said. It was what came next, and what it might mean for other researchers. “It was the digital unfolding that really astonished me,” she said. “I can’t wait to see that new technique applied on other tricky in-situ manuscripts.”Dr. Fabry-Tehranchi expressed a similar hope. “There are still things to be discovered,” she said.

Central Myanmar is especially prone to powerful quakes.,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/28/world/myanmar-earthquake/central-myanmar-is-especially-prone-to-powerful-quakes,2025-03-28T10:51:47Z,World,,,,,,"The quake shook a swath of Southeast Asia. Myanmar’s military government said 144 people were killed in just three cities. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the death toll was likely to surpass 1,000. In Bangkok, at least seven were killed in the collapse of a partly constructed high-rise building. A damaged roadway in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Central Myanmar, the scene of a powerful earthquake on Friday, lies near the eastern end of one of the world’s most active zones of seismic activity: the Alpide Belt, which extends from the Mediterranean Sea eastward through Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan, then along the Himalayas to Myanmar and finally Indonesia. The epicenter of the quake on Friday was near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city with more than a million people. While much of Myanmar is susceptible to earthquakes, Mandalay and the surrounding towns sit right on top of one of four places in the country that are particularly prone to unusually powerful quakes, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Program. The other three places are in much less populated parts of the country. Large plates of the Earth’s crust are in motion in Myanmar. These plates are slowly grinding together. Underground rocks can become stuck for many years, before lurching up, down or sideways in strong earthquakes like the one on Friday. The plate on which India sits is gradually moving north and crunching underneath western China. That plate movement is pushing up the Himalayas, the world’s tallest mountain range. But the eastern edge of the Indian Plate is also bumping under the Burma Platelet, which holds Myanmar. The Burma Platelet is also in motion because the floor of the Andaman Sea, which lies between India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, is slowly widening. The complex interaction of these plates produces many fault lines across central and northern Myanmar, many of which are poorly understood and some of which have not even been named by geologists. Powerful earthquakes occur because of the movement of large plates of the Earth’s crust across the magma underneath. The speed of these plates varies, but they generally move as fast as a person’s fingernails grow. Myanmar’s military government made an extraordinary plea for international assistance after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday, shaking a vast expanse of Southeast Asia and leaving destruction in its wake. The full extent of the toll was hard to assess in a country that has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. The ruling junta said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — not including Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, which lies near the epicenter. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000and could be much higher. In neighboring Thailand, at least seven people were killed and dozens were missing after a skyscraper under construction collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok. The appeal for international aid from Myanmar’s military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, was highly unusual for the junta, which is under heavy sanctions by the United States, Britain and others. Humanitarian groups said they were having difficulty assessing the damage because electricity and communication lines were down. The earthquake struck Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, around 12:50 p.m. local time. Bleeding victims were rushed to hospitals by ambulance, car and motorbike after the quake — the third of its magnitude to hit the region in the past century. Buildings were left in ruins, and a doctor at Mandalay General Hospital said so many people had arrived for treatment that nurses had run out of cotton swabs and he had no place to stand. Dozens of patients at the hospital — the main medical facility in the city, which has more than a million people — wereforced to flee to a nearby parking lot. Many were still hooked up to intravenous drips and oxygen tanks, some lying on cardboard or directly on the ground. Outside the hospital, Daw Kyi Shwin, 45, was bleeding heavily. She said that her 3-year-old daughter had been killed when their house began to collapse as they were having lunch. “I tried to run to her,” she said, “but before I could, bricks fell on me too.”Here’s what else to know: Humanitarian aid: Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability arelikely to complicate the global humanitarian aid responsedespite the rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. In a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Limited information: Myanmar’s junta has repeatedly shut off the internetand cut access to social media to thwart dissent and prop up its rule. That has cut the country off from the world digitally, and details of the destruction in many parts of Myanmar were not immediately available. Bridges and several buildings in Myanmar have collapsed, including in Naypyidaw, the capital, The Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-owned newspaper, reported. Chaos in Thailand: In Bangkok, more than 600 miles from Mandalay, videos showed water surging from pools atop high-rise hotels and residential towers. Videos verified by The New York Times showed thecollapse of a 30-story skyscraperthat was under construction as workers and passers-by ran for safety. At least seven people were reported killed in the collapse, and 20 people were stuck in an elevator, an official said, and it was unclear if they were still alive. Active quake zone: Myanmar is in one of the world’smost seismically active regions. Amagnitude 6.8 earthquakein eastern Myanmar killed more than 70 people and shattered hundreds of buildings in 2011. The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said an unspecified number of people had been injured in Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely to, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakePatients had to lie on cardboard or directly on the concrete outside the main hospital in Mandalay. Even before the earthquake, the health care system in Myanmar was under stress. In the parking lot of Mandalay General Hospital, dozens of patients — many with their heads and arms bandaged — were lined up on stretchers, or cardboard, in 100-degree heat. Many more lay directly on the concrete. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said Dr. Kyaw Zin, a surgeon at the hospital. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”He said the hospital was so jammed with injured people after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that “there is no space to stand.” Phone lines were down so he has not been able to contact his parents. “I’m very worried about my parents,” he added. “But I can’t go back home yet. I have to save lives here first.”Even before the quake, the health care system in Myanmar had been pushed to its limits. The military junta that has led the country since a 2021 coup has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has opposed the regime. Myanmar isone of the most dangerous places in the worldto be a health worker, according to New York-based Physicians for Human Rights. Dr. Kyaw Zin said that he was about to start surgery when the earthquake struck. Everybody, including patients, ran outside. On Friday afternoon, ambulance sirens shrieked. The injured kept coming. Nurses checked on patients in the parking lot, some of whom were hooked up to intravenous drips. People moaned for help. The smell of blood hung in the stifling heat. The junta said it did not have the full death toll. Damage to infrastructure could hinder access to regions that have already been struggling amid a bloody civil war. The epicenter of the earthquake, the Sagaing region, has been a focus of resistance to military rule. The World Health Organization said information was still hard to get because of aftershocks and disruptions to communications systems. The agency added that it was looking to send trauma supplies from its logistics hubs to support Myanmar.

Since seizing power four years ago, the military junta that controls Myanmar has gradually become so weakened that some analysts have predicted it could soon collapse, in a scenario similar to the rebel overthrow of Syria’s government in December. With the financial and military backing of benefactors — including China, India, Russia and Thailand — the junta has managed to maintain its grip. It controls about 20 percent of the territory, mainly urban areas, amid a civil war that had left nearly 20 million people without sufficient food, shelter or security even before Friday’s earthquake, according to a report this week by the United Nations humanitarian aid agency. Myanmar’sbleak economyhas stirred widespread anger against the junta, which has grappled withhigh levels of defections. Its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing,has been accusedof crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. General Min Aung Hlaing has kept up persecution of ethnic minorities, including this montharresting the leaderof an armed group that has sought to protect Rohingya Muslims from ascorched-earth campaignof arson, mass rape and killing that the United Stateshas called genocide. The Trump administration so far has taken a largely hands-off approach to Myanmar, although in January itjoined an allianceof democratic countries condemning the junta and urging it to de-escalate violence. The move aims to contain Myanmar’s instability and prevent another surge of people fleeing the country, after about one million Rohingya have already escaped to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. But India, Russia and China all have provided weapons to the junta, and Thailand has given it financial support and defended it against international condemnation,according to an analysisby the Council on Foreign Relations. China, which has sold jets, drones, artillery and electromagnetic jammers to help the junta battle rebels, sees the military-led government as the only force that can hold Myanmar together. But Beijing has hesitated to fully endorse the February 2021 coup and appears to be looking for what theStimson Center, a foreign policy research group, described this month as an “off-ramp” for the junta. Last year, China pledged $3 billion in assistance to the junta, in part to finance a census and some semblance of elections. But the Stimson Center’s report said that “Beijing seems unconvinced that a transition to a federal democratic system is possible.”General Min Aung Hlaing’s recent moves indicate that he is trying at least to be seen as responsive to international pressure. On Thursday, he announced that Myanmar would hold “dignified” elections in December. He is reportedly planning tovisit Thailand next weekfor meetings with regional leaders, a rare visit abroad for what hisspokesman describedas discussions with “potential for peace.”On Friday, with reports of extensive damage from the quake still coming in, a military spokesman appealed for international aid and said it would cooperate with foreign donors, an unusual step for a junta that has not asked for assistance in past disasters. The announcement suggested that the authorities expect the death toll to be high.

Military rulers have been criticized for blocking delivery of international aid during past disasters, but this time the junta is already asking for help. Reporting from BangkokThe greatest damage caused by Friday’s 7.7 earthquake was in the region of central Myanmar controlled by the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago. The hardest hit areas included Naypyidaw, the regime’s capital, and Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, where structures collapsed and at least 20 people died. The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers search for survivors. Areas of the country that are controlled by rebel forces opposed to the junta are farther from the quake’s epicenter and appear to have come through largely unscathed, although reports of damage in remote areas may be slower to emerge. During past disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the country’s military rulers restricted the flow of international aid to hard-hit areas that were dominated by their political foes. But this time, the junta’s approach to recovery efforts may be different. Within hours of the quake, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing appealed for international aid and declared a state of emergency in six regions of the country, news agencies reported, including Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Two years ago, Cyclone Mocha swept through areas dominated by rebel forces and killed hundreds of people, including in Rakhine and Chin States. Days later,international aid providers complainedthat the junta was blocking the delivery of much needed aid. Similarly, when Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy Delta region in 2008, an earlier military government was widely criticized for its slow delivery of assistance. At the time, the United States accused that regime of“criminal neglect”in its handling of the disaster. Medical workers and supplies outside of a hospital in Napyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Since 2021, the ruling military junta has severely restricted the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country. After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday, the internet was filled with videos, images and social media posts documenting the damage in Thailand. But across the border in Myanmar, where the devastating quake was centered, there has been a far murkier picture about the scale of the diaster. Information from Myanmar has been harder to come by in part because of the country’s history of internet censorship. In recent years, the military has repeatedly shut off the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country from the rest of the world. The blocks have been intended to thwart dissent and prop up the country’s military rulers. Freedom of the press has also been severely restricted. But in an emergency like the earthquake, where power outages and infrastructure damage can already hinder access to the internet, such restrictions can further limit what information is available and can potentially affect the delivery of aid. Shortly after the quake, even the government struggled to stay online, as several official websites controlled by the junta were inaccessible. Myanmar’s military took power in a coup in 2021, seizing control of the country’s telecommunications networks, allowing it to shut down internet access in certain areas and create communications blackouts, according to Access Now, a digital rights organization. Despite widespread internet blocks, some areas have better connectivity than others. In regions where rebel groups have been fighting against the military, internet is particularly unreliable, with many using the satellite-based service Starlink to get online, said Joe Freeman, a Myanmar researcher at Amnesty International. The quake struck central Myanmar on Friday around 12:50 p.m. local time, causing damage in cities as far away as Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. The quake hit near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city after Yangon, and a strong aftershock was recorded shortly thereafter. Mr. Freeman said Myanmar’s internet blocks and censorship policies are surely having an effect on getting information about the extent of the disaster in the country. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Mr. Freeman said. The information black hole is a stark contrast to the reality of the country before the coup, when growing numbers of Facebook-addicted smartphone users posted huge amounts of memes, political debates and videos during previous crises, like the spread of Covid and protests against the military coup. Rescue workers at the scene of a construction site in Bangkok, where a building collapsed on Friday. A building in Bangkok that had been under construction collapsed, killing at least eight people, while dozens of workers remained stuck in the rubble. The 33-floor skyscraper shook, and then in a flash it crumbled, its glass facade cascading down into a heap of rubble. Construction workers on the site scurried for safety as a massive dust cloud billowed out. On the street outside, people ran for cover, some jumping into cars and speeding away. At the construction site, in northern Bangkok, at least eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing as of Friday evening, according to Anutin Charnvirakul, a deputy prime minister. They were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. About 70 people were taken to local hospitals. The rescue operation continued into the night as sniffer dogs searched for survivors. But the death toll was expected to rise. The nearby Chatuchak Park was being kept open through the night for people as a rest area, as were other parks — Benjakitti, Lumphini and Benjasiri. Traffic remained snarled hours after the earthquake hit and many people were unable to get home. Earlier in the day, throngs of panicked residents ran outside after Bangkok’s skyline swayed. Afterward, in central Bangkok, plazas and sidewalks were packed with crowds of office workers, shopkeepers and tourists who remained outside for fear of aftershocks and structural damage to the buildings. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand declared Bangkok an “area of emergency,” asking residents to evacuate from tall buildings in case of aftershocks. Other videos showed water sloshing out of therooftop swimming poolof a high-rise hotel and spilling down the side of the building. The city’s elevated train, known as the Skytrain, was shut down and traffic on the city’s major arteries came to a virtual standstill as people tried to return home. Office towers, shopping malls and hotels evacuated their employees and guests while they conducted inspections to determine whether there had been damage before allowing them back inside. Pam Kershaw and her husband, tourists from Melbourne, Australia, were in their room on the 25th floor of the Athenee Hotel when the earthquake struck. The room began swaying and pictures banged against the walls. “It was very scary,” she said as she sat outside the hotel with hundreds of others waiting to go back inside. Sui-Lee Weecontributed reporting from Bangkok. Workers carrying an injured person near the site of the collapsed building. Chinesestate media reportedthat an unspecified number of people were injured and houses damaged in Ruili, a city in Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar. Ina videofrom Ruili shared by state media, a cloud of dust billowed from a tall building as people ran down the street away from it. Other videos shared widely online showed rubble in the streets. A Ruili residenttoldChinese official media that he had been riding his bicycle, when buildings and trees along the road began shaking. The resident, identified as Mr. Zhang, said that the beams of his home had cracked, and that the garages of some shopping malls had collapsed. Other videos showed light fixtures shaking in an apartment in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, nearly 500 miles away. China’s National Earthquake Data Centerwroteon social media that tremors were also felt in Guizhou and Guangxi, regions that do not border Myanmar. The aftershock that struck about 11 minutes after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake was stronger than initially thought. The U.S. Geological Survey, which originally reported that the aftershock’s magnitude was 6.4, has raised the level to 6.7. President Trump said Friday that the United States would provide assistance to Myanmar following the deadly earthquakes. “It’s a real bad one, and we will be helping,” he said in the Oval Office. “We’ve already spoken with the country”Emergency personnel continued to work after sundown at the scene of a collapsed building in northern Bangkok, where dozens were still missing. The United Nations said it had allocated an initial $5 million from its emergency fund to help life-saving operations in Myanmar and other areas impacted by the earthquake. Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the organization was gathering information to better guide its response and direct resources. He said the earthquake had worsened “an already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar, where nearly 20 million people need assistance across the country, including more than 3.5 million displaced from their homes.”The Myanmar military’s death toll of 144 is only from the three cities of Sagaing, Kyaukse, and Naypyidaw, suggesting that the total scaleislikely to be higher. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake toppled century-old stupas in a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, Shan State, just 70 miles from the epicenter. “Pindaya felt some earthquakes before but not so strong like today’s,” the monastery’s Facebook page administrator said by email, adding, “Most stupas are old ones and believed to be over 100 years old.”The photographs showed elaborate golden spires smashed on the ground, and red bricks strewn around the site. The foundations of other monuments and buildings were badly cracked. The earthquake severely damaged a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, in Myanmar’s Shan State, about 70 miles from the epicenter. Several century-old stupas that adorned the religious site were toppled, photos obtained by The New York Times showed. And a witness video, geolocated by The Times to a street beside the monastery, captured the collapse of the largest of the golden stupas during an aftershock. Women wailed at the sight, as young Buddhist students exited the complex through a side gate. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said the U.N. system was mobilizing to help the people in need. In Mandalay, as the night deepened, terrified residents dragged their mattresses and mosquito nets out to the streets to sleep. Some planned to spend the night in their cars. Many were too scared to return to their homes. The population in the stricken region “resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,” the report said, adding that “recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as landslides.”The U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks seismic activity around the world, warned ina reporton Friday: “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread.”Outside Mandalay General Hospital, patients keep streaming in. An ambulance siren wails, even after it stops to deliver a victim into the parking lot of the overwhelmed hospital. In Bangkok, at least seven people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing at a building that collapsed, as of Friday evening, according to the authorities. The military government in Myanmar said 144 people were dead and 732 injured. The agency warned that “the impact of the earthquake in Myanmar is likely to be severe, with possibly thousands of displaced people in need of urgent shelter, food and medical aid.” “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” the group said. The International Rescue Committee says local media have reported at least 80 people were killed in Myanmar. One rescue worker in the city of Mandalay, Tun Min Latt, said the death toll had reached 86, with 60 those in Mandalay alone. The World Health Organization says it is looking at sending trauma supplies from its logistic hubs to support Myanmar. Myanmar has declared a state of emergency in six regions: Sagaing, Mandalay, Naypyidaw, Bago, Magway and Northeastern Shan State, according to Gen. Zaw Min Tun. In Bangkok, at the site of a building that had collapsed, an official told reporters that 70 people were still missing. A further 20 people were trapped in an elevator shaft, and it was unclear if they were alive. Outside the overwhelmed Mandalay General Hospital, there was chaos. Injured victims lay on stretchers, with their heads bandaged, moaning from the pain. There was a pool of blood. An ambulance siren wailed. When the vehicle stopped, two men carried a male victim down. General Zaw Min Tun said the government did not know the total number of casualties yet but that it was doing all it could to help the victims. The junta’s appeal for aid to the international community is extremely rare. In previous natural disasters, it has almost never asked for humanitarian aid. The call suggests that the authorities expect the death toll to be large. The Myanmar military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, said, “we need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid.” He added, “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”The structure that collapsed was constructed in 2015, historical satellite imagery shows. Times journalists reported from the monastery in 2019; it was once attended by the infamous monk, Ashin Wirathu, who was jailed for hate speech directed against the Rohingya in Myanmar. In a striking Facebook video verified by The Times, Buddhist monks at the New Masoeyein monastery in Mandalay survey the remains of an ornate clock tower toppled by the powerful quake. As they look on, the multistory monastery building collapses before them. The head of Myanmar’s military junta, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, visited a 1,000-bed hospital in Naypyidaw, the country’s capital, after the earthquake. Dr. Kyaw Zin said there were so many injured people in the hospital that he had no space to set foot. Dr. Kyaw Zin, a doctor at the Mandalay General Hospital, said the death toll is now at 20, with at least 300 injured. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” he said. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”The number of injured in Myanmar is expected to rise. By late afternoon, more victims started turning up at the Mandalay General Hospital, arriving by ambulance, car and motorbike. Many of them were bleeding heavily."

"Ukraine Stages New Push Into Russia, Officials and Experts Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/ukraine-attack-russia-belgorod.html,2025-03-28T09:37:22Z,World,"The small incursion targets the Belgorod region, according to Ukrainian officials, analysts of open-source intelligence and Russian military bloggers. The advance comes as cease-fire talks continue.",Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022); Defense and Military Forces; Peace Process,,Russia; Ukraine; Belgorod (Russia),,"Cathedral Square in the city of Belgorod last year. The region’s governor said in a social media post that parts of the region were currently unsafe, but did not mention Ukrainian troops crossing the border. Reporting from Kyiv, UkraineUkraine Stages New Push Into Russia, Officials and Experts SayThe small incursion targets the Belgorod region, according to Ukrainian officials, analysts of open-source intelligence and Russian military bloggers. The advance comes as cease-fire talks continue. In a major bet last summer, Ukraine launched a daring offensive on Russian soil, the first invasion of Russia since World War II. Thatincursion into the Kursk regionstunned Moscow and provided a much-needed morale boost for Ukrainians, but after months of fierce fighting, Russia has recentlyclawed back almost all of the territorylost. As efforts now intensify to reach a peace agreement between Kyiv and Moscow, Ukraine appears to be gambling again with a small-scale incursion into Russia. In recent days, the Ukrainian Army has staged a new cross-border push into the Belgorod region, according to Ukrainian officials, analysts of open-source intelligence and Russian military bloggers. While the extent of the Ukrainian push into Belgorod was unclear and Ukraine’s intentions are unclear, military analysts said it was possibly an effort to draw Russian forces from Kursk to alleviate pressure there. Kyiv may also hope that grabbing another patch of Russian land could provide added diplomatic leverage, analysts said. But Moscow hasshown no willingnessto make real concessions while Ukrainian troops remain on Russian territory, and Kyiv’s new push comes with obvious risks as they remain stretched across the vast front line. The incursion appears to be much more limited in scope than the Kursk operation and has so far only secured a thin band of territory across the border, military analysts say, citing video of the battle they have verified. It was unclear how many troops were involved or the extent of the Russian response. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged a new attack on Russian soil. But three Ukrainian military and government officials confirmed that an operation was continuing in the Belgorod region of southern Russia, near territory Ukrainecaptured in the neighboring Kursk regionlast summer. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential operation. Russia has not said anything publicly about any Belgorod incursion. The Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said in a Telegramposton Friday that parts of the region were currently unsafe, citing drones and artillery attacks, but he did not mention Ukrainian troops crossing the border. Andriy Kovalenko, a senior Ukrainian government official focused on Russian disinformation operations, declined to say if a cross-border incursion had taken place. But he said that fighting continued to protect Ukraine from a Russian attack and that included “the destruction of enemy concentrations on the territory of Belgorod region, because the enemy planned to use these concentrations on our territory.”Russian military bloggers, including the prominent analystValery Shiryaev, said that Ukraine had used armored vehicles to cross the border and that, in response, Russia had deployed Chechen battalions, regular army soldiers and naval infantry. Both Russia and Ukraine have been trying to secure and strengthen their positions — on the battlefield and diplomatically — before the next United States-brokered talks begin at a yet-to-be-determined date. Talks held by U.S. envoys separatelywith Ukraine and with Russiathis week in Saudi Arabia have failed to cement a broad cease-fire deal. And commitments made by Moscow and Kyiv fora truce in the Black Seacame with many caveats and have so far done nothing to stop attacks there. In the Belgorod region, Ukrainian forces crossed the border on March 18 and advanced into the village of Demidovka, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research organization that analyzes open-source intelligence. The forces later moved into three additional settlements near the border, the organization said. Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, said that several videos verified and geolocated by his organization showed Ukrainian forces entering the Belgorod region. Ukraine, he said, managed “to secure a proper buffer zone of defendable terrain and capture several villages along the border within the first few days of the attacks,” before Russia brought in reinforcements. One village, Demidovka, now appears to be under Ukrainian control, he said. Videos verified by The New York Times confirm the presence of people in military uniforms in the village of Demidovka in the region of Belgorod. The Times could not confirm the people in the footage were Ukrainian forces. Maj. Gen. Viktor Nazarov, a former senior adviser in Ukraine’s General Staff Headquarters, said that Kyiv was most likely hoping the operation would improve its negotiating position by capturing more Russian land. Similar hopes of gaining concessions by taking the Kursk region have dimmed as Russian forces have taken back territory, said General Nazarov, currently at the International Alliance for Human Resources Readiness, a research institute. Mykhailo Samus, the director at the independent New Geopolitics Research Network in Kyiv, said the operation seemed intended to block a potential Russian attack into Ukraine and to divert Russian forces from other fronts, as well as to strengthen Ukraine’s position in talks. The operation, he said, would show that “Ukraine is acting proactively and that Ukrainian arguments need to be considered.”Ivan Nechepurenkocontributed reporting from Tbilisi, Georgia,Nataliia Novosolovafrom Kyiv, andSanjana Varghesefrom London.

Hegseth Seeks to Reassure Allies on First Official Trip to AsiaAt his first stop in the Philippines, the U.S. defense secretary promised to strengthen deterrence against Chinese “threats” in the region. He also plans to visit Japan. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth used his first trip to Asia to try to reassure allies that the United States was committed to deterring Chinese “threats” to the region, while also again defending his recent actions indisclosing American battle plansin a group chat. Speaking at a news conference in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on Friday, Mr. Hegseth said that the Trump administration would “truly prioritize and shift to this region of the world in a way that is unprecedented.”“Today, it’s the Philippines. Tomorrow, it’s Japan. It will be Australia and South Korea and other nations in this part of the world,” he said, where, together, “we will establish the deterrence necessary to prevent war.”The Philippines was the first stop of Mr. Hegseth’s tour of Asia, which will also include Japan; both countries have mutual defense treaties with the United States. But they and others in the region have been anxiously watching President Trump call into question the United States’ decades-old alliances in North America and Europe. The Philippines has been involved inincreasingly tense standoffswith China in the South China Sea over Beijing’s expansive territorial claims. Japan also has protestedrepeated Chinese incursionsinto waters near disputed islands in the East China Sea. On Friday morning, Mr. Hegseth met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., telling him that “deterrence is necessary around the world, but specifically in this region, in your country, considering the threats from the communist Chinese.”During the news briefing, Mr. Hegseth brought up unprompted the controversy around his role in sharing information about U.S. military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on the commercial messaging app Signal. He said it was not his job to determine where the U.S. Seventh Fleet goes in Asia but that he would defer to U.S. Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and “his war plans.”“Real war plans,” Mr. Hegseth added, drawing chuckles. He said that Admiral Paparo would help create “strategic dilemmas for the Communist Chinese that would help them reconsider whether or not violence or action is something they want to undertake again.”Mr. Hegseth was asked about whether he feels any responsibility for his role in the Signal controversy. He dodged the question, saying that he is proud of “that initial series of very effective and devastating strikes and the ongoing campaign that we are undertaking” against the Houthis. Mr. Hegseth said the United States would conduct special operation forces training with the Philippines in the Batanes islands, which are about 120 miles south of Taiwan, a flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. He also added that the United States would deploy an anti-ship missile system and unmanned surface vehicles to the Philippines during the joint U.S.-Philippines military drills in April. Mr. Marcos’s government is hoping to build on deepening ties that it forged during the Biden administration. The Philippines sees itself on the frontline of the territorial fight against Beijing in the South China Sea. “I would like to categorically state that what is at stake in our unilateral and bilateral activities is not merely the security of either the United States or the Philippines,” Gilberto Teodoro, the Philippines defense secretary, said. “We are facing a common threat, which is the overreach of the Communist Party of China.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move. U.S.-Iran Talks: Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last,opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitionsand avoid war.

Iran Signals Openness to Indirect Talks After Trump LetterTehran neither rejected negotiations nor accepted face-to-face talks in its response to President Trump’s letter calling for talks to curb Iran’s advancing nuclear program. Here’s what to know. Iran announced on Thursday it had responded to a letter from President Trump in which the American president had urged direct negotiations with the government in Tehran on a deal to curb the country’s advancing nuclear program. Iran appeared to be taking the middle ground, neither rejecting negotiations with the United States nor accepting face-to-face talks with Mr. Trump. But Kamal Kharazi, the top foreign policy adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, according to local news reports, “The Islamic Republic has not closed all the doors and is willing to begin indirect negotiations with the United States.”The countries have not had official diplomatic relations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, but they have engaged directly and indirectly on issues like the nuclear program, detainee swaps and regional tensions. Iran said it submitted its written reply to Mr. Trump through Oman on Wednesday. The foreign minister of Iran, Abbas Araghchi, said Tehran had presented a comprehensive view on the issues raised by Mr. Trump and on the overall situation in the Middle East, according to the official news agency IRNA. “Our policy is to not negotiate directly while there is maximum pressure policy and threats of military strikes,” Mr. Araghchi said on Thursday. “But indirect negotiations can take place as they have in the past.”President Trump sent his letter to Iran’s supreme leader earlier this month. What did the Trump letter say? Mr. Trump sent the letter this month to Mr. Khamenei, sayinghe preferred diplomacy to military action. “I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing,’” Mr. Trump told Fox News. “You can’t let them have a nuclear weapon.”On March 12, Anwar Gargash, a senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates who traveled to Tehran to deliver Mr. Trump’s letter, told Iranian news media that it contained “threats” and also an opportunity. Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s special envoy to the Middle East, revealed more details in aninterview with Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News host who is now a popular podcaster. Mr. Witkoff said the letter roughly said: “We should talk, we should clear up the misconceptions, we should create a verification program so that nobody worries about weaponization of your nuclear material.”An Iranian official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly said that Mr. Trump had set a two-month deadline for Iran to negotiate,a detail initially reported by Axios. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, a research institute based in London, said the letter-writing between Tehran and Washington showed that both sides were “sizing each other up and finding different channels, some public and many private, to define what they can achieve.”“This is an opportunity for both sides,” she added, “but it comes with a thousand risks and challenges.”Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaking in Tehran last week, in a photo released by an official website of his office. He has said he does not believe that Iran would gain any benefit from talks with the United States. What is the view in Iran? Since Mr. Trump’s election, officials and pundits in Iran have publicly debated the topic, with a conservative hard-line faction vehemently objecting to talks or concessions and a moderate and reformist faction arguing that negotiations are necessary to lift sanctions. Mr. Khamenei, who has the last word on all key state matters,has said he does not believe that Iran would gain from talks. President Masoud Pezeshkian, a moderate, has distanced himself from that view,telling Parliament this month that he favored negotiationsbut would follow Mr. Khamenei’s directive. On Thursday, Mr. Khamenei’s office signaled a shift in tone, based on Mr. Kharazi’s remarks. What other options are being considered? If talks on a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program fail, Israel and the United States have suggested the possibility of launching targeted strikes on the two main underground nuclear facilities in Iran, Natanz and Fordow. But that risks setting off a wider regional war since Iran has warned it would respond to any strikes on its soil. And any attacks could destabilize the Middle East, with Tehran turning to its network of weakened but still active proxy militias, like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the West and Israel are concerned thatTehran has been secretly planning a faster, cruder approachto building a weapon. In 2018, Mr. Trumppulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear dealwith Iran and imposed tough economic sanctions. The moves prompted Iran to abandon its commitments to the deal and increase uranium enrichment from a cap of 3.5 percent to 60 percent now. The United Nation’s nuclear watchdog says in its latest report that Iran has stockpiled enough enriched uranium to make several bombs. But the watchdog says it has found no evidence that Iran is weaponizing its program. “Iran is at a crossroad, between having an off ramp or being militarily hit,” said Ms. Vakil, of Chatham House. “It’s a year of really consequential decisions, and how they play their hand could give them a lifeline or lead to further strikes and weakening of the government.”Gun ControlRoll Back: The Trump administration is expected toroll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, according to two people briefed on the move. U.S.-Iran Talks: Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last,opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitionsand avoid war.

The British aerospace manufacturer H.R. Smith Group donated to the party soon after he was announced as Reform’s leader. Reporting from LondonMajor Donor to Reform U.K. Party Sold Parts Used In Weapons to Russian SupplierThe aerospace company H.R. Smith Group was an early backer of the party after Nigel Farage became leader. Reform has faced criticism over comments seen as supporting Moscow. One of the biggest corporate donors to the populist Reform U.K. party has sold almost $2 million worth of transmitters, cockpit equipment, antennas and other sensitive technology to a major supplier of Moscow’s blacklisted state weapons agency, documents show. From 2023 to 2024, the company, part of the British aerospace manufacturer H.R. Smith Group, shipped the equipment to an Indian firm that is the biggest trading partner of the Russian arms agency, Rosoboronexport. H.R. Smith Group donated 100,000 pounds (just under $130,000) to Reform U.K. last year, two days after Nigel Farage was announced as the party’s leader. The company is run by Richard Smith, a businessman who owns 55 Tufton Street, a Westminster townhouse that is home to some of Britain’s most influential right-wing lobbying and research groups. H.R. Smith Group said that its sales were lawful and that the equipment was destined for an Indian search-and-rescue network. The parts “support lifesaving operations” and are “not designed for military use,” said Nick Watson, a lawyer for the company. H.R. Smith Group is run by Richard Smith, who owns a London townhouse that is home to several influential British right-wing lobbying and research groups. The records do not prove that H.R. Smith’s products ended up in Russia. But they show that, in some instances, the Indian company received equipment from H.R. Smith and, within days, sent parts to Russia with the same identifying product codes. The components have civilian and military uses and have been flagged by the British and American authorities as critical to Russia’s war effortin Ukraine. Officials have urged exporters to carry out detailed checks to ensure that their clients are not redirecting restricted equipment to Moscow. The Indian state-owned company, Hindustan Aeronautics, is identifiable in public records as a supplier to the Russian military but is not under financial sanctions. H.R. Smith declined to say what due diligence it conducted before making the sales, or whether it sought assurances from Hindustan Aeronautics that its products would not end up in Russia. India’s willingness totrade with Russia, despite Western sanctions, has complicated efforts to isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and undermine his military. Hindustan Aeronautics did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Farage is trying to establish himself as the new voice of British conservatism, but has generated controversy at times over comments perceived as pro-Russian. Most Britons support Ukraine,polls show, and last year,support for Reform U.K. fellafter Mr. Farageclaimed thatthe West had provoked Russia into the war. Last month, the former leader of Reform U.K. in Wales appeared in court onaccusations of accepting bribesto make statements in the European Parliament that would benefit Russia and its invasion of Ukraine. Reached by phone, Mr. Farage said that he has “never approved of anything Putin has done,” but declined to comment on H.R. Smith’s sales. A party spokesman said the donation was lawful. “Such woeful attempts to smear Reform will not work,” the spokesman said. What the records showThe New York Times reviewed shipping records showing that Techtest, which is owned by the H.R. Smith Group, made 118 shipments of restricted technology to Hindustan Aeronautics in 2023 and 2024. The parts, identified usingspecific international codes, were sold for almost $2 million. During that period, the Indian firm made at least 13 shipments of the same type of parts to a buyer for Rosoboronexport, which is blacklisted by the British and American authorities. The Russian arms agency paid more than $14 million for the equipment, according to the records. On Sept. 2, 2023, for example, Techtest sold Hindustan Aeronautics two shipments of restricted equipment, including location transmitters and remote controllers. Nineteen days later, the Indian company sold parts to Russia with matching identification codes. A Rosoboronexport weapon at an exhibition in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2023. Rosoboronexport, Russia’s state arms agency, is blacklisted by U.S. and British authorities. Techtest sold another shipment of restricted technology to India on Feb. 4, 2024. Eighteen days later, Hindustan Aeronautics sold equipment with matching codes to a buyer for Rosoboronexport, customs data shows. The British and American governments banned the sale of those goods, known as “common high priority items,” to Russia after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Is this legal? Companies are required to investigate their customers before selling sensitive technology. Mr. Watson said that H.R. Smith takes its “supply chain obligations extremely seriously” and follows all relevant export controls. The Times shared details of the sales with five experts on U.K. and U.S. export control and sanctions. Every expert said that, depending on what due diligence Techtest carried out, the company may have breached export controls. Some said it was a possible sanctions violation. The National Crime Agency, sometimes referred to as Britain’s F.B.I., issued a“red alert”in 2023 warning businesses to watch out for intermediaries that redirect sensitive equipment to Russia. Publiccorporate recordsshow that Rosoboronexport is Hindustan Aeronautics’ biggest trading partner. The Indian firm is also listed as a Russian supplier in commercial due diligence tools and screening databases that the U.S. government advises exporters to check. Techtest made more than 70 shipments of “Tier 2” items — one of the most sensitive technology categories — to Hindustan Aeronautics from 2023 to 2024, customs records show.

Ramadan TV Series Stokes Tensions Between Sunni and Shiite Muslims,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/middleeast/ramadan-muawiya-series.html,2025-03-28T09:00:52Z,World,"The story of a divisive Islamic ruler from ancient times, produced by a broadcaster in the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has drawn rebukes from Shiite-majority Iran and Iraq.",Television; Sunni Muslims; Shiite Muslims; Ramadan,,Middle East,MBC Group,"The Syrian actor Lojain Ismail plays the title role in the Ramadan series “Muawiya,” a divisive figure in Islamic history who is revered by Sunni Muslims but reviled by many Shiites. Reporting from Dubai, United Arab EmiratesRamadan TV Series Stokes Tensions Between Sunni and Shiite MuslimsThe story of a divisive Islamic ruler from ancient times, produced by a broadcaster in the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has drawn rebukes from Shiite-majority Iran and Iraq. A new TV series airing for the holy month of Ramadan is stoking sectarian tensions in the Middle East with the story of a divisive figure in Islamic history who is revered by Sunni Muslims but reviled by many Shiites. The series, “Muawiya,” tells the story of Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, a major figure in early Islam. He was one of Islam’s early rulers and the founder of the Umayyad dynasty — the first hereditary rulers in Islam where power passed down within the same clan. He was also a reputed companion of the Prophet Muhammad. The show chronicles events in the seventh century that led to Islam’s first civil war between Sunnis and Shiites. The show was produced by a media conglomerate in Saudi Arabia, which, like most other Middle Eastern countries, is dominated by Sunnis. Some in Shiite Iran and Iraq, one of the only Arab countries with a Shiite majority, are balking. Iraq’s media regulator said on March 1, the first day of Ramadan, that itwould blockbroadcasts of the series. “The airing of historically controversial content could provoke sectarian debates, threatening social harmony and disrupting the fabric of society, especially during Ramadan,” the regulator said at the time. Ramadan, when many Muslims fast daily from dawn to dusk, is alsopeak television season in the Arab world, when families watch shows late into the night after breaking their fast. The controversy over “Muawiya” began two years ago when the Saudi-owned MBC Group announced plans for what it said would be a groundbreaking series and billed it as one of the most expensive shows ever produced in the Arab world. The drama seemed to be headed for air duringRamadan 2023. But the Iraqi government demanded that its Saudi counterparts cancel the broadcast, citing concerns that it could stir sectarian tensions. The influential Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr weighed in at the time. The series was “contrary to the new, moderate policies pursued by the brotherly country of Saudi Arabia,” he said. “There is no need to hurt the feelings of your Muslim brothers,” added Mr. al-Sadr, who largely stepped back from active politics in 2022 but stillcommands a significant following among Shiite Muslims. The Saudi government then postponed the broadcast, saying the series was still in production. But since 2023, the geopolitical dynamics of the Middle East have shifted. Shiite-majority Iran and Iraq have banned the show out of concern that it could stir sectarian tensions between Shiites and Sunnis. Iran, a longtime Saudi rival for power and influence across the Middle East, has been weakened over the past year and a half. A good number of its regional proxies and allies have either suffered setbacks in wars with Israel or, in the case of the Assad dictatorship in Syria, fallen from power entirely. This month, the Saudi broadcaster MBC began airing “Muawiya.”After Persian-subtitled episodes surfaced online in Iran, the country’s media regulatory agencyannounced a banat the beginning of Ramadan on dubbing and streaming the show across all on-demand platforms, websites and social media accounts. Some Sunni religious leaders in the region have also voiced opposition to the series. Abdel Fattah Abdel Ghani al-Awari, a senior scholar at Egypt’s al-Azhar, the most influential center of Sunni Muslim learning, said the portrayal of Prophet Muhammad’s companions on-screen was haram, or religiously impermissible. Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan is viewed as a key opponent of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph and a central figure inShiite IslamThe Sunni-Shiite divide can be traced back to the year 632 after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The central dispute was over who should lead the Muslim world. Sunnis wanted leadership to be decided by consensus, leading to the appointment of Abu Bakr as Islam’s first ruler or caliph. Shiites, however, believed that leadership should stay within the prophet’s family, favoring Ali — the prophet’s cousin and son-in-law — as his rightful successor. Muawiya would play a central role in the first civil war in Islam following the assassination of the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan. After Ali was killed in 661, Muawiya challenged Ali’s son, Hasan, for control of the caliphate. Hasan would later give up his claim to avoid further bloodshed. The power struggle was central to the Sunni-Shiite split, shaping tensions that still ripple through the Middle East today. The show’s efforts to highlight Muawiya’s legacy have been interpreted by some as a statement in favor of Sunni dominance. The show’s writer, Khaled Salah, defended the series, insisting it did not take sides. “Our main goal with this project was not to emphasize the narrative of the victor over the vanquished,” Mr. Salah told The New York Times on Thursday. “Instead, we produced this series to present future generations in the Muslim world with what happened, from a humanitarian aspect, during past Islamic civil wars and the lessons we can learn from them today.”The Saudi production company MBC has faced criticism in the past for fueling sectarian tensions between Saudi Arabia and Shiite countries. Last year, Iraqi authoritiessuspended MBC’s broadcast licensein the country after a news report labeled former leaders of the Iran-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah as “faces of terrorism.”Soon after, Iran-linked Iraqi militiasstormed MBC’s officesin Baghdad, damaging equipment, footage on social media showed.

Chinesestate media reportedthat an unspecified number of people were injured and houses damaged in Ruili, a city in Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar. Ina videofrom Ruili shared by state media, a cloud of dust billowed from a tall building as people ran down the street away from it. Other videos shared widely online showed rubble in the streets. A Ruili residenttoldChinese official media that he had been riding his bicycle, when buildings and trees along the road began shaking. The resident, identified as Mr. Zhang, said that the beams of his home had cracked, and that the garages of some shopping malls had collapsed. Other videos showed light fixtures shaking in an apartment in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, nearly 500 miles away. China’s National Earthquake Data Centerwroteon social media that tremors were also felt in Guizhou and Guangxi, regions that do not border Myanmar. The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar has reached 1,644, the country’s authorities said on Saturday, even as rescue workers raced against time in search of survivors in the ruins of apartments buildings, monasteries and mosques. The 7.7-magnitude temblor, which struck just outside Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday afternoon, sent shock waves around Southeast Asia and even beyond. In Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles from the quake’s epicenter, a 30-story building that was under construction collapsed. Grim vigils were being heldon Saturday as rescue workers searched for survivors. But the earthquake was particularly devastating to areas nearthe Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south through the center of Myanmar, destroying buildings and roads and downing power lines. The number of dead and injured in Myanmar, a country ruled by a military junta that has restricted contact with the outside world, was expected to rise, though it may be months before the full scale of the devastation is understood. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey suggested the number of deaths was likely tosurpass 10,000. Mandalay, a city of around 1.5 million people, was hard hit. People were stocking up on fuel and food in preparation for days without power, and patients were camped outside the city’s overcrowded main hospital. The city’s streets were jammed on Saturday with ambulances heading to a hospital two hours away, where there was more room. Volunteers rushed to Mandalayto try to help find survivors, even as hopes dimmed. Ko Thien Win, a rescue worker who rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, pleaded for skilled help and heavy machinery, such as excavators. “Yesterday we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower,” he said. The disaster is compounding the monumental challenges facing Myanmar’s military rulers, who overthrew an elected government in 2021, and questions are swirling aboutwhether they will manage to stay in power. The junta has already lost ground to rebels amid abloody civil warthat left nearly 20 million of the country’s roughly 54 million people without enough food or shelter even before the quake, according to U.N. officials. On Friday evening, junta fighters dropped bombs on a rebel-held village. There were no casualties, but residents were stunned that the military would resume attacks in the immediate wake of the disaster. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of the bombed village. Here’s what else to know: Building collapse: Rescue workers in Bangkok werescouring for survivorsat the site of the building collapse. Eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were thought to be buried in the rubble. Aid complications: The earthquake prompted an extraordinary appeal from Myanmar’s government for outside aid. Some international aid started to arrive, with China and India sending blankets, food and teams to help search for survivors. But the junta is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its long isolation, internal instability and major logistical hurdles areexpected to complicate the global responseShock waves: The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said people were injured in the city of Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

A woman in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, carrying rice provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development after a devastating earthquake in 2010. A powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,600 people in Myanmar comes as the Trump administration is dismantling the main U.S. agency for distributing foreign aid, a step that is likely to inhibit recovery efforts in the isolated Asian country. As the 7.7-magnitude earthquakecaused buildings to collapse, downed power lines and ripped up roads in the Mandalay region of Myanmar on Friday, the Trump administration wasdetailing final plansto effectively eliminate the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, by cutting its staff to about 15. Already, the agency, which had about 10,000 employees before President Trump returned to office, hasbeen defunded, and nearly all of its foreign aid contracts have been terminated. At least 7,000 staff members have been fired orput on leave. The Trump administration has been slowed in its effort to gut the agency by court battles, but an appeals court on Fridaycleared the wayfor further cuts. Mr. Trump said on Friday that the United States would offer aid to Myanmar,telling reporters, “We’re going to be helping.” But the initial U.S. response has been muted. Other countries, including China and India, have begun sending food, blankets and search teams to Myanmar, where modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey suggeststhe number of deaths is likely to surpass 10,000. But Myanmar’s government, controlled by a junta that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021, is under heavy sanctions from the United States, Britain and others, and its isolation is expected to complicate the global response. In the past, the United States would “almost invariably” have sent search teams and released money to nonprofit organizations to aid survivors, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign disaster assistance office. “The first 24 to 48 hours after a major disaster are the time of peak frenzy, because that’s when you’re getting the search-and-rescue teams spun up and organizing the airlifts,” Mr. Konyndyk said. “But none of that’s happening.”Instead, on Friday, workers who remained at U.S.A.I.D. received messages informing them of their“final mission”and detailing the further elimination of jobs. The Trump administration says it will keep a small group of essential staff members in U.S.A.I.D. under the umbrella of the State Department. A message sent to workers on Saturday asked them to indicate their “preferred status during the transition.”After the earthquake, the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at U.S.A.I.D. released a formal declaration of humanitarian needs in Myanmar, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The New York Times. The declaration said that U.S.A.I.D. was “in communication with its international human partners” and that a three-person U.S. “assessment team” was prepared to travel to Myanmar. The declaration did not appear to have been published online — U.S.A.I.D.’s website has beenstripped down to a notificationthat staff members are on leave — and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. “I’d love to see them pull back the teams that they’ve fired and really mount a serious response” to the earthquake, Mr. Konyndyk said. But he added, “The fact that they fired everyone on the day this was all going on does not suggest there’s much seriousness about a real U.S. response.”U.S. rescue teams have traditionally provided not only sophisticated equipment, but also expertise to assist local teams on search methods, Mr. Konyndyk said. “When the donor that normally provides about 40 percent of global humanitarian financing leaves the field, no one else can really fill that gap,” he said, referring to America’s role in global relief efforts. “The absence of the U.S. here is going to mean fewer live rescues of people who could be saved. Full stop.”David PiersonMyanmar’s military chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, arriving to meet earthquake survivors gathered at a hospital in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. As people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake, some were stunned by the military government’s decisions in the wake of the catastrophe: It had resumed attacks on its own citizens. Myanmar is torn by civil war and its government is run by a junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, that overthrew the country’s elected government in 2021. The warhas ravaged this Southeast Asian country. About half of its territory is now in rebels’ hands, while the military has fortified its presence in the big cities. The junta has for years beenaccused of committing atrocities, and had terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes, outpaced in recent months only by those rained down on Gaza. The United States, Britain and other countries have imposed heavy sanctions on the junta, although nations such as India and China have maintained ties with it. The earthquake on Friday prompted an unusual appeal from Myanmar’s government for international assistance, and some residents hoped for a reprieve from the civil war. Instead, within hours of the earthquake, the airstrikes had restarted. On Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders the Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a Naung Lin resident. “Min Aung Hlaing is creating a killing field in Myanmar.”There were no casualties, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township had died in aerial raids.

Allies and detractors have responded to the military government’s pleas for aid, but delivery could be hampered by physical and diplomatic obstacles. Reporting from LondonInternational aid and rescue workers began arriving in Myanmar on Saturday after the powerful earthquake forced the military junta to look outside for help. But aid agencies and governments seeking to assist will not only have to navigate destroyed roads and airports, but also a host of political obstacles. Myanmar has been cut off by Western nations since 2021 when the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. A civil war between the military government and rebel groups opposing its autocratic leadership has carved the country up into a fractured state. The military government’s allies, including China and Russia, were some of the first to respond with aid. China dispatched a 37-member search-and-rescue team, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Russia quickly followed suit, sending two planes carrying 120 rescue workers,according to TASS, the state-run news agency. India, which has managed a delicate relationship with Myanmar, sent 15 tons of relief material early on Saturday. It was also dispatching a field hospital of 118 medical specialists, two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four naval ships of emergency assistance. It is not clear, however, how the aid will be distributed, given both the destruction and the junta’s grip on the country. The European Union, which hasissued sanctionsagainst Myanmar’s military leaders, answered the regime’s rare call for help with a 2.5 million euro, about $2.7 million,emergency aid package. The E.U. did not respond for a request for comment on exactly where the aid would go. The earthquake is the first major natural disaster since the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, further complicating the global response. President Trump said Friday that the United States would still offer assistance, the same day his administrationlaid out its plansto put the U.S. Agency for International Development fully under the State Department and to reduce its staff to some 15 positions. The Associated Press cited a State Department spokeswoman as saying that U.S.A.I.D. staff members still in Myanmar would be mobilized. Already stretched by multiple crises — including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and more — humanitarian aid agencies now have to contend with the “closure of U.S.A.I.D. and the loss of significant amounts of money in that system,” said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. When the earthquake struck on Friday, the International Rescue Committeesaidit had begun to prepare for even more displaced people than had already been forced to flee their homes by the civil war. “In any earthquake scenario, access is always difficult,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the vice president overseeing international programs at the International Rescue Committee. “And that’s even more so the case in a conflict situation in a country with very poor infrastructure.”Myanmar had long posed a unique set of challenges to aid groups. To navigate Myanmar’s complex political and social terrain, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has relied on a network of 6,400 volunteers who work alongside a much smaller staff, and who know how to navigate the country’s system, said Afrhill Rances, the agency’s spokeswoman for the region. But, she said, with electricity and phone lines down, the airport shuttered and roads destroyed it was quickly becoming clear that more people and more resources would be needed.

Rescue workers in Mandalay on Saturday. A long line of motorbikes outside of a gas station. Volunteers gathered to help, some coming in from other cities, to do whatever they could in the city near the epicenter of the powerful quake. Reporting from BangkokIn Mandalay, near the epicenter of the quake that rocked the region, volunteer rescue workers raced against time as they combed through the ruins of apartments, monasteries and mosques to find survivors. Others struggled to come to terms with all they had lost. Downed power lines, destroyed roads and a lack of equipment made rescue work even harder in a city already enduring a repressive military government and a civil war that is now in its fourth year. “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside,” said Thaw Zin, a volunteer who was sitting in front of a destroyed condominium. “We are trying our best with what we have.”The earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. Friday local time, was only the third of such magnitude to hit the region in the past century. The extent of the catastrophe remains enormous: the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions. These include rebel-controlled areas where there is little internet and millions of displaced people. In one neighborhood in Mandalay, countless buildings were reduced to rubble, satellite images showed. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Ms. Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”On Saturday, the streets were jammed with ambulances that were heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The overcrowded hospitals in Mandalay were unable to accept more patients. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking. He fell from the tree he was in, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, no doctors were available, so he waited all night, in pain, and finally saw a doctor Saturday morning. Mr. Tay Zar Lin, who got married last month, said he had just learned that his wife was still trapped inside a collapsed building that houses the tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” said Mr. Tay Zar Lin, whose leg is in a cast. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”He said that if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s ousted and imprisoned civilian leader, were in charge now, “many trapped people would have been rescued, and unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.”There was growing anger against the military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021. Mr. Thaw Zin, the volunteer rescuer, said soldiers and police officers had turned up but did nothing to help. “They are here hanging around with their guns,” he said. “We don’t need guns, we need helping hands and kind hearts.”By Saturday morning, dozens of ordinary people from other cities in Myanmar had packed their cars and vans with supplies and headed into Mandalay, hoping to pitch in. Doctors from the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement — the resistance movement against the junta — traveled from the rebel-held areas of Kayin, Tanintharyi and Lashioto to help, many of them returning to their hometown. Several international aid groups said they were rushing to the disaster sites. “None of us are trained for earthquake rescues,” said Ko Thein Win, a volunteer rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed condominium. “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today, the chances are much lower.”He said they urgently needed skilled rescue workers and heavy machinery such as excavators. Eaint Thadar Phyu, 18, an English teacher in Mandalay, said she was on the second floor of the hostel where she was staying when the earthquake struck. She was hurrying to pack up some basic items such as her identification card when an aftershock hit. “I thought I was going to die,” she said. Ms. Eaint Thadar Phyu said she couldn’t sleep Friday night because of a series of aftershocks. “I was scared they would turn into a huge one again.”The scope of the death toll was still unclear, but the scale of the disaster was stark: heaps of collapsed rubble, from monasteries to condominiums, dotted the landscape. Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million, is Myanmar’s second-largest city. A former royal capital, it is known as a center for Burmese culture and Buddhism, home to numerous temples, monasteries and pagodas. On Saturday morning, shaken residents gathered at hospitals and relief centers, and contemplated all that they had lost. Red tents were set up for rescue workers to rest in 100-degree heat. Residents talked about how their home had become a ruined city. Many were still walking around in tears. Long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power.

The Myanmar rebels have fought hard with little international support. In a censored nation that runs on rumor and omens, people in Myanmar wonder whether the latest disaster might be a portent of regime change. The dust from the devastating earthquake on Friday was still churning in Myanmar when an existential question swirled into the mix: Could this fatal clash of tectonic plates, which added yet another layer of trauma to a country already plagued bycivil war, also portend the demise of Myanmar’s ruling junta? The earthquake, known to have killed at least 1,000 and probably many more than that, struck a day after Myanmar’s military regime celebrated the country’s80th Armed Forces Daywith a parade in Naypyidaw, the capital purpose-built by a previous group of generals. The sequence of events was hard to ignore. Omens and rumors have long been prized in an authoritarian country with little free flow of information. When the ruling generalsgrabbed powerfour years ago, they sealed off the country and reverted to a reverence of superstition and propaganda. And earthquakes do figure into astrological almanacs that are well thumbed in Myanmar. A popular version states that an earthquake in March signals the destruction of cities, while one in July is an augury of kings and rulers deposed. The junta’s stronghold remains in the cities, like in Mandalay, the second-largest in the country and one of the hardest hit by the earthquake. Daw Marlar Myint, 89, said this was the worst natural disaster she had ever experienced. A retired school principal, she is not waiting until July to cast her prediction. “We have a saying that a massive earthquake like this is nature’s way of punishing a cruel and corrupt ruler,” she said. “After killing so many people, Min Aung Hlaing is now facing the judgment of nature.”“Even the bones of those he murdered are trembling,” she added. Since Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing overthrew Myanmar’s elected government in 2021,has flared in this Southeast Asian country. The majority of territory is now in resistance hands, with the military fortified in the big cities. The junta has terrorized civilian areas with airstrikes outpaced in recent months only by those rained on Gaza. The Myanmar rebels — anunwieldy assortmentof ethnic minority militias, opposition politicians and tech-savvy youth who are honing drone warfare out of jury-rigged parts — have fought hard with little international support. The Myanmar military is bleeding soldiers, with desertion rife. Still, it is punishing jungle warfare, and both sides are desperate for an exit. And as people in Myanmar surveyed the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, with screams from those trapped under the wreckage still echoing through towns, the full extent of the devastation is only beginning to take shape. In Photos and VideosKo Kyaw works in Singapore, part of the large diaspora of young, educated people from Myanmar who fled their country to look for better jobs overseas. He had been sending money back home to his parents, wife and two daughters, ages 4 and 7. They all died in the earthquake, when their condominium building in Mandalay crashed to the ground. Their bodies were part of a pile arranged inside a nearby hall, no space for burial yet. For most of its post-colonial history, Myanmar, previously known as Burma, has been ruled by military dictatorships. Generations of generals have relied on fortunetellers and astrologers to guide their policy decisions. A former junta chief consulted a dwarf who spoke through her sister. (That sister continued to prognosticate after her sibling died, but her prophecies lost authenticity, according to those who initially paid a lot of money for her solo consultation sessions.)One former spy chief collected white elephants (the real, live kind) to burnish his power. An earlier junta leader was so superstitious about the number nine that he denominated the country’s currency by it, including 45 and 90 kyat notes. And General Min Aung Hlaing, the current military chief, has consecrated temples and a giant Buddha in Naypyidaw to burnish his reputation. He has collected white elephants, too. For the generals, perhaps the most consequential prophecy came in 2005. That is when seers determined the precise timing most auspicious for beginning a secret move of Myanmar’s capital from Yangon to an as-yet unnamed construction site in the center of the country. After consultations with fortunetellers, trucks began a convoy north to what would soon be called Naypyidaw, or the abode of kings. Today,the new capitalis defended by hills and invulnerable to attack by sea, unlike Yangon. When Cyclone Nargis slammed into the old capital and the nearby Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing, Naypyidaw was unscathed. The generals celebrated their bunkered capital, with its grand boulevards, massive ministries and penguins on ice (again, the real, live kind). But Friday’s earthquake was not so benign to Naypyidaw. Government ministries cracked. Portraits of top leaders, including of General Min Aung Hlaing, fell to the floor. The air traffic control tower in the capital toppled, killing at least seven people, according to Myanmar state media. In hills not too far away, rebel forces are watching. With fewer high buildings in the territory they control, the earthquake on Friday had less effect on them. But even as residents of Mandalay and other urban areas, like Sagaing and Kyaukse, dug through the rubble with their bare hands, prying out each brick to get closer to possible survivors, the Myanmar military resumed itsold habitsOn Friday evening, in northern Shan State, which borders Mandalay Region, junta fighter jets dropped bombs on Naung Lin village, which is held by the rebels. There were no casualties this time, but sorties two days before killed four people in nearby villages. And a week and half before that, 10 people sheltering in a seminary in the same township died in aerial raids. In Yangon, an astrologer for a top junta official said that the top brass’s belief in star signs has not waned. If anything, they are hanging on even more to faith as their grip on the country diminishes, she said. The astrologer, who did not want her name used because of the sensitivity of speaking about her high-profile military clients, said that General Min Aung Hlaing relies heavily on Buddhist talismans to stay in power. On Saturday morning, a military intermediary called her, the astrologer said, and requested help in protecting the junta chief’s hold on Myanmar. She advised a Buddha amulet, to be worn at all times. But, the astrologer said, she thought the earthquake was an ominous sign for the general. Workers waiting on Saturday for news of missing relatives and co-workers at the site of an under-construction building that collapsed in Bangkok. Rescue teams with dogs walking at the site of the building that collapsed after the earthquake. Rescuers searching for victims. Scores of people are missing in the ruins of a high-rise building that was felled by the quake in Myanmar. Signs of life raised hopes on Saturday, but there was no update on survivors. The pile of rubble was nearly seven stories high. There was a cloud of dust. And there was punishing, 96 degrees Fahrenheit heat. Rescue workers were desperately scouring for survivors on Saturday at the site of the high-rise building in Bangkok that collapsed after the powerful earthquake in Myanmar. Eight people were confirmed dead at the site but scores more are missing, mostly workers buried as the 33-story structure, which was under construction,caved in on itselfnear the city’s Chatuchak Park. The rescue crews used several excavators to dig through the debris, dump trucks to carry it away and sprayed mists of water to improve visibility. Relatives of some of those trapped have looked on, hoping that their loved ones might be pulled out alive. Earlier in the day there was a flicker of hope. Crews detected signs of life of 15 survivors in multiple locations, Suriyachai Rawiwan, the director of the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, told reporters. Some were buried under 10 feet of rubble. But there had been no updates on survivors by 3 p.m. local time, almost 24 hours afterthe earthquakerocked Bangkok. Those trapped were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. “The building came down so fast,” said Than Htike, 42, adding that he was still in shock. The father of two from Bago in Myanmar said he was on the ground floor and managed to escape, but his wife, who was helping build the elevator shaft on the 6th floor, was still missing. Mr. Than Htike said he spent all of Friday afternoon and night at the site, hoping for a sign of life from his wife and colleagues who are still trapped under a huge pile of rubble. “I only want my wife back,” he said, standing alongside a handful of other construction workers from Myanmar. Like other migrant workers from Myanmar, economic hardship in their home country forced the couple to seek employment in Thailand. They had been working at construction sites in Bangkok for the past three years, earning about 400 Thai baht, roughly $10, a day. Natthanan Kaewkaiyasit, 49, was also among those still waiting for news about their loved ones at the site. Her partner, Noy Thicha, a 53-year-old welder, was missing. “We have to hope for miracles. I will stay here, waiting,” she said. Aubonrat Setnawet, 44, was at the construction site when the quake hit. “I felt everything swaying. I thought I was going to faint because everything dizzy,” she said. “Then I heard a kind of cracking sound, then I ran out with the others. I saw the building swayed before it collapsed.”She had started working at the site earlier this month with her husband, who was missing. She, too, said that she was hoping for a miracle. A rescue and medical team departing from Kunming, China, to earthquake-stricken Myanmar on Saturday. Reporting from Hong KongChina sent dozens of rescuers to Myanmar on Saturday to help with search efforts after the earthquake, Chinese state media said, publishing photos of the team clad in orange jackets and red helmets boarding a plane in the predawn hours. The 37-member team will fly to Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and travel by road to Naypyidaw, the capital. It is carrying rescue equipment, including life-detection devices and drones, according to the Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid. Few countries have a greater stake in Myanmar’s recovery than China, which is one of the first countries to send rescue teams after the earthquake. Beijing has stood by Myanmar’s ruling junta ever since it toppled the country’s civilian government in 2021. It has supplied weapons, including fighter jets and drones, to fight rebel groups, even in the face of mounting evidence of military atrocities. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent condolences to the head of Myanmar’s military government, Min Aung Hlaing, and pledged assistance, Chinese state media reported. A day earlier, in a statement of support for the people of Myanmar, China’s foreign ministry said the two countries enjoyed a “profound ‘pauk-phaw’ friendship,” using a Burmese term for sibling. Myanmar is a crucial node in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project intended to strengthen China’s trade routes and expand its influence. One of China’s most important pieces of infrastructure is a pair of pipelines carrying oil and gas from ports in the Bay of Bengal on Myanmar’s western coast to China’s southwestern Yunnan Province. It is unclear if those pipelines were damaged by Friday’s earthquake and its aftershocks. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakeRebel forces in Myanmar’s Sagaing region, a center of resistance against the military regime, are using elephants to help clear destroyed roads, according to the National Unity Government, the shadow government in exile. The death toll in Myanmar now stands at 1,644 and 3,408 people are injured, according to the Myanmar military. But, given the scale of the devastation, the death toll is still expected to rise significantly. India’s immediate response, in addition to the 15 tons of relief material that arrived early in the morning, includes a field hospital of 118 medical specialists (incidentally the same field hospital that had deployed to help after Turkey’s earthquake), two aircraft carrying teams of 80 search and rescue specialists and four navy ships of humanitarian and disaster response material. The quake was especially damaging to Myanmar’s historic and religious sites. It toppled pagodas and minarets, collapsed Buddhist monasteries and mosques, and reduced centuries-old monuments popular with tourists to rubble. See the damage inphotographs and videosshared by witnesses and verified by The Times. Tay Zar Lin was picking mangoes when the ground started shaking and he fell, breaking his leg. At a hospital in Mandalay on Friday, he was told that there were no doctors available. He waited all night, in pain, until he was able to see a doctor this morning. He said he had just discovered that his wife was still trapped inside a tailor shop where she works. “I don’t know if she’s alive or not,” he said. “I pray that yesterday morning wasn’t the last time I saw her.”At the Wisdom Villa private high school in Mandalay, several students were believed to be trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building. Video by the AFP news agency showed how rescuers called out names repeatedly on Saturday, hoping to hear any signs of life. Su Wai Lin managed to escape with her husband and mother-in-law when the earthquake struck, but she said her husband ran back into their apartment building in Mandalay to save their 90-year-old neighbor. Then, the building collapsed, killing her husband and the neighbor. “I can’t put into words the pain I feel,” said Su Wai Lin, who is six months pregnant, weeping as she spoke at a hospital. “My child will be born without a father. We may have survived physically, but our hearts and emotions are shattered.”Indian humanitarian aid arrived in Yangon on Saturday morning, and Modi said further assistance and search and rescue teams “are being expeditiously dispatched to the affected areas”India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to the chief of Myanmar’s military junta, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, offering help and solidarity “with a close friend and neighbor.” India shares a long border with Myanmar, and Mr. Modi’s government has maintained a delicate balance in the relations: calling for restoration of democracy while maintaining contact with the military leadership. Nee, an engineer who is the leader of an association of former residents of Mandalay now living in Taiwan, said that many multistory school buildings appear to have collapsed in the quake, citing word from friends there. “Many buildings were strong enough for maybe a magnitude 6 earthquake, but anything above magnitude 6, like this time, was too much. At my old school, a four-story building totally collapsed.” Most of the students at the school appeared to have escaped or been rescued, he said. Richard Nee, one of tens of thousands of residents of Taiwan who migrated there from Myanmar in past decades, said he and other former residents of Mandalay were waiting for word from relatives and friends still there. He said that the wife of a friend had died, apparently when a building collapsed, but sporadic communication made getting information difficult. The streets of Mandalay are jammed with ambulances that are heading to Pyin Oo Lwin, a town that is about a two-hour drive from Mandalay. The hospitals in Mandalay are overcrowded and cannot accept more patients. In Mandalay, long lines formed at gas stations as people stocked up on fuel, preparing for days without power. Residents are rationing food. The lack of equipment, downed power lines, and destroyed roads are making rescue efforts even more challenging in a country already grappling with a four-year civil war. Ko Thein Win, a rescue worker at the same site, said: “Yesterday, we found some survivors, but today the chances are much lower.” He said the workers urgently needed skilled help and heavy machinery such as excavators. Thaw Zin, a rescue worker who had rushed to the site of a destroyed apartment building in Mandalay, said: “There are at least a hundred people still trapped inside. We are trying our best with what we have.” Soldiers and police officers turned up but did not lift a finger to help with rescue efforts, Thaw Zin said. On Friday evening, hours after the earthquake hit, Myanmar military jets dropped bombs on the village of Naung Lin in northern Shan State. The village is held by rebel forces. “I just can’t believe they did airstrikes at the same time as the earthquake,” said Lway Yal Oo, a resident of Naung Lin. At the site of the building collapse in Bangkok, rescuers are working with heavy equipment to move rubble. But they have to be careful not to harm anyone who might be trapped underneath. “It’s a very difficult task, and it’s risky work for the rescuers as well,” said Piyalux Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, a local charity. The death toll in Myanmar is now 1,002, according to the military government. Another 2,376 people are injured, it said. The general took control of the country in 2021 in a military coup and seized control of the country’s telecommunications networks. The restrictions have made it harder to gather information from Myanmar during disasters like this. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s army leader, surveyed disaster sites and visited a makeshift hospital in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, on Friday, state media showed. China’s foreign aid agency said it would provide nearly $14 million in humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, Chinese state media said. The National International Development Cooperation Agency, also known as China Aid, said it would send tents, blankets, first aid kits, food, drinking water and other supplies starting on Monday. The National Unity Government, Myanmar’s shadow government in exile, says the country urgently needs medicines, ready-to-eat meals, solar-powered lamps, temporary shelters and heavy machinery to clear debris. South Korea will provide $2 million for earthquake victims in Myanmar. The aid will be shipped through international humanitarian agencies, the foreign ministry of South Korea said. Malaysia will send two teams of 50 people in total to support disaster relief efforts in Myanmar, the government said.

Myanmar’s military government said 144 people were killed in just three cities. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the death toll was likely to surpass 1,000. In Bangkok, at least seven were killed in the collapse of a partly constructed high-rise building. Myanmar’s military government made an extraordinary plea for international assistance after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday, shaking a vast expanse of Southeast Asia and leaving destruction in its wake. The full extent of the toll was hard to assess in a country that has largely been isolated from the rest of the world. The ruling junta said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — not including Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, which lies near the epicenter. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimates that the death toll is likely tosurpass 1,000and could be much higher. In neighboring Thailand, at least seven people were killed and dozens were missing after a skyscraper under construction collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok. The appeal for international aid from Myanmar’s military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, was highly unusual for the junta, which is under heavy sanctions by the United States, Britain and others. Humanitarian groups said they were having difficulty assessing the damage because electricity and communication lines were down. The earthquake struck Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, around 12:50 p.m. local time. Bleeding victims were rushed to hospitals by ambulance, car and motorbike after the quake — the third of its magnitude to hit the region in the past century. Buildings were left in ruins, and a doctor at Mandalay General Hospital said so many people had arrived for treatment that nurses had run out of cotton swabs and he had no place to stand. Dozens of patients at the hospital — the main medical facility in the city, which has more than a million people — wereforced to flee to a nearby parking lot. Many were still hooked up to intravenous drips and oxygen tanks, some lying on cardboard or directly on the ground. Outside the hospital, Daw Kyi Shwin, 45, was bleeding heavily. She said that her 3-year-old daughter had been killed when their house began to collapse as they were having lunch. “I tried to run to her,” she said, “but before I could, bricks fell on me too.”Here’s what else to know: Humanitarian aid: Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability arelikely to complicate the global humanitarian aid responsedespite the rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. In a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Limited information: Myanmar’s junta has repeatedly shut off the internetand cut access to social media to thwart dissent and prop up its rule. That has cut the country off from the world digitally, and details of the destruction in many parts of Myanmar were not immediately available. Bridges and several buildings in Myanmar have collapsed, including in Naypyidaw, the capital, The Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-owned newspaper, reported. Chaos in Thailand: In Bangkok, more than 600 miles from Mandalay, videos showed water surging from pools atop high-rise hotels and residential towers. Videos verified by The New York Times showed thecollapse of a 30-story skyscraperthat was under construction as workers and passers-by ran for safety. At least seven people were reported killed in the collapse, and 20 people were stuck in an elevator, an official said, and it was unclear if they were still alive. Active quake zone: Myanmar is in one of the world’smost seismically active regions. Amagnitude 6.8 earthquakein eastern Myanmar killed more than 70 people and shattered hundreds of buildings in 2011. The shaking was felt as far away as Bangladesh, Vietnam andsouthern China, where state news media said an unspecified number of people had been injured in Ruili, near the Myanmar border.

Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake that devastated central Myanmar on Friday was the result of slippage along a fault line between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates running north to south through the center of the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The movement between the plates was a lateral, side-to-side rubbing, what seismologists call astrike slip,most likely along the Sagaing Fault, which runs from central to northern Myanmar. The epicenter was reported to be near the city of Sagaing, at a depth of six miles, and the heaviest seismic activity ran along a line from Sagaing to the city of Meiktila, some 80 miles to the south. “While commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as a slip over a larger fault area,” the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The slippage seems to have occurred in a narrow corridor of land about 124 miles long and 12 miles wide, it said. Measuring 7.7 in magnitude, the earthquake hit at 12:52 p.m. local time and was felt across Myanmar, Thailand, southern China and Laos. Much of the population in the hardest hit part of Myanmar lives in structures that are vulnerable to earthquakes, the U.S. report said. Earthquakes in the area have in the past also caused landslides and other hazards, it added. “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread,” the U.S. survey said. This region has been prone to similar strike-slip earthquakes in the past. Since 1900, at least six others measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, the U.S. agency said. The most recent was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, which caused 32 buildings to fall. Rescuers search for survivors in a damaged government staff housing building in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Earthquake-stricken Myanmar faces a humanitarian crisis. Political complexities are likely to hamper international aid delivery, leaving vulnerable people at risk. Myanmar’s long isolation and its internal instability are likely to complicate the global humanitarian aid response to the earthquake that struck on Friday, despite a rare plea for outside help from the country’s military-dominated government. “We need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid,” said the military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun. “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”Myanmar was cut off by the United States and many other Western nations in 2021, after the military seized power in a coup and imposed a brutal crackdown. Even before the coup, the country had been under various sanctions for decades, most recently over organized violence against the Rohingya minority. Western sanctions include carve-outs for humanitarian aid, and the United Nations said on Friday that it was mobilizing help for those in need. But in a country ravaged by civil war, major logistical hurdles remain in getting the aid to the people who most need it. Michael Martin, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the security and safety of international aid workers in reaching affected regions is one issue. There is also a risk that the military prevents aid workers from reaching rebel-held areas, or will slow-walk the delivery of aid, including by repackaging it to appear as if it is from the military rather than international institutions, said Dr. Martin, who was the former lead analyst on Myanmar for the Congressional Research Service. The military could also prevent relief workers from getting visas or delay processing times, he added. And, while many international aid organizations were founded on the principle that delivery of aid should not be political, in practice, that is not always possible. The military “may attempt to direct more of the assistance to areas that are nominally under their control” than areas under control of opposition forces, Dr. Martin said. When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Syria’s northwest region two years ago, under the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad,little international aidreached the region in the immediate aftermath. Some survivors had to dig through rubble by hand, as the government limited what went to opposition-held areas. In Myanmar, the military has ruled oppressively for most of the time since 1962; and even during periods of limited liberalization, the armed forces remained a major political power. For much of that time, the country has restricted contacts with the outside world. Stefan Dercon, an economics professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, said that another issue may be transferring funds into Myanmar, whether through sanctioned banks run by officials or other channels, and the logistics of getting supplies to the right areas. “The delivery of humanitarian aid will be very, very complicated,” Dr. Dercon said. “Humanitarian operations are fundamentally logistical operations, and they need cooperation from a lot of people.”Another issue is raising necessary funds, he said. Given Myanmar’s isolation from the West, there is unlikely to be a big queue of international, Western donors, he said. Dr. Martin also said that it was not clear to what extent the U.S. government would help, given the Trump administration’s hostility to foreign aid programs and major cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. The area hit hardest by the earthquake is heavily populated, suggesting that the death toll may rise significantly. Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, with about 1.5 million people, sits very near the epicenter. And heavy damage to buildings was reported as far as Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, almost 650 miles away. Modeling by the United States Geological Survey roughly estimates that the death toll is likely to, and could be much higher. A death toll of more than 10,000 is a strong possibility, given the proximity of populated areas and the vulnerability of nearby structures, the estimates suggest. A full understanding of the extent of the devastation may take weeks or months. It takes time to figure out how many are buried under rubble, and Myanmar’s junta keepsa tight hold on the internet, limiting information about the quake. More maps of the earthquakePatients had to lie on cardboard or directly on the concrete outside the main hospital in Mandalay. Even before the earthquake, the health care system in Myanmar was under stress. In the parking lot of Mandalay General Hospital, dozens of patients — many with their heads and arms bandaged — were lined up on stretchers, or cardboard, in 100-degree heat. Many more lay directly on the concrete. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” said Dr. Kyaw Zin, a surgeon at the hospital. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”He said the hospital was so jammed with injured people after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that “there is no space to stand.” Phone lines were down so he has not been able to contact his parents. “I’m very worried about my parents,” he added. “But I can’t go back home yet. I have to save lives here first.”Even before the quake, the health care system in Myanmar had been pushed to its limits. The military junta that has led the country since a 2021 coup has cracked down on doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has opposed the regime. Myanmar isone of the most dangerous places in the worldto be a health worker, according to New York-based Physicians for Human Rights. Dr. Kyaw Zin said that he was about to start surgery when the earthquake struck. Everybody, including patients, ran outside. On Friday afternoon, ambulance sirens shrieked. The injured kept coming. Nurses checked on patients in the parking lot, some of whom were hooked up to intravenous drips. People moaned for help. The smell of blood hung in the stifling heat. The junta said it did not have the full death toll. Damage to infrastructure could hinder access to regions that have already been struggling amid a bloody civil war. The epicenter of the earthquake, the Sagaing region, has been a focus of resistance to military rule. The World Health Organization said information was still hard to get because of aftershocks and disruptions to communications systems. The agency added that it was looking to send trauma supplies from its logistics hubs to support Myanmar.

Since seizing power four years ago, the military junta that controls Myanmar has gradually become so weakened that some analysts have predicted it could soon collapse, in a scenario similar to the rebel overthrow of Syria’s government in December. With the financial and military backing of benefactors — including China, India, Russia and Thailand — the junta has managed to maintain its grip. It controls about 20 percent of the territory, mainly urban areas, amid a civil war that had left nearly 20 million people without sufficient food, shelter or security even before Friday’s earthquake, according to a report this week by the United Nations humanitarian aid agency. Myanmar’sbleak economyhas stirred widespread anger against the junta, which has grappled withhigh levels of defections. Its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing,has been accusedof crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. General Min Aung Hlaing has kept up persecution of ethnic minorities, including this montharresting the leaderof an armed group that has sought to protect Rohingya Muslims from ascorched-earth campaignof arson, mass rape and killing that the United Stateshas called genocide. The Trump administration so far has taken a largely hands-off approach to Myanmar, although in January itjoined an allianceof democratic countries condemning the junta and urging it to de-escalate violence. The move aims to contain Myanmar’s instability and prevent another surge of people fleeing the country, after about one million Rohingya have already escaped to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. But India, Russia and China all have provided weapons to the junta, and Thailand has given it financial support and defended it against international condemnation,according to an analysisby the Council on Foreign Relations. China, which has sold jets, drones, artillery and electromagnetic jammers to help the junta battle rebels, sees the military-led government as the only force that can hold Myanmar together. But Beijing has hesitated to fully endorse the February 2021 coup and appears to be looking for what theStimson Center, a foreign policy research group, described this month as an “off-ramp” for the junta. Last year, China pledged $3 billion in assistance to the junta, in part to finance a census and some semblance of elections. But the Stimson Center’s report said that “Beijing seems unconvinced that a transition to a federal democratic system is possible.”General Min Aung Hlaing’s recent moves indicate that he is trying at least to be seen as responsive to international pressure. On Thursday, he announced that Myanmar would hold “dignified” elections in December. He is reportedly planning tovisit Thailand next weekfor meetings with regional leaders, a rare visit abroad for what hisspokesman describedas discussions with “potential for peace.”On Friday, with reports of extensive damage from the quake still coming in, a military spokesman appealed for international aid and said it would cooperate with foreign donors, an unusual step for a junta that has not asked for assistance in past disasters. The announcement suggested that the authorities expect the death toll to be high. Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago, at a hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Friday. Military rulers have been criticized for blocking delivery of international aid during past disasters, but this time the junta is already asking for help. Reporting from BangkokThe greatest damage caused by Friday’s 7.7 earthquake was in the region of central Myanmar controlled by the military junta that seized power in a coup four years ago. The hardest hit areas included Naypyidaw, the regime’s capital, and Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city, where structures collapsed and at least 20 people died. The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers search for survivors. Areas of the country that are controlled by rebel forces opposed to the junta are farther from the quake’s epicenter and appear to have come through largely unscathed, although reports of damage in remote areas may be slower to emerge. During past disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the country’s military rulers restricted the flow of international aid to hard-hit areas that were dominated by their political foes. But this time, the junta’s approach to recovery efforts may be different. Within hours of the quake, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing appealed for international aid and declared a state of emergency in six regions of the country, news agencies reported, including Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Two years ago, Cyclone Mocha swept through areas dominated by rebel forces and killed hundreds of people, including in Rakhine and Chin States. Days later,international aid providers complainedthat the junta was blocking the delivery of much needed aid. Similarly, when Cyclone Nargis struck the Irrawaddy Delta region in 2008, an earlier military government was widely criticized for its slow delivery of assistance. At the time, the United States accused that regime of“criminal neglect”in its handling of the disaster. Medical workers and supplies outside of a hospital in Napyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Since 2021, the ruling military junta has severely restricted the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country. After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday, the internet was filled with videos, images and social media posts documenting the damage in Thailand. But across the border in Myanmar, where the devastating quake was centered, there has been a far murkier picture about the scale of the diaster. Information from Myanmar has been harder to come by in part because of the country’s history of internet censorship. In recent years, the military has repeatedly shut off the internet and cut access to social media, digitally isolating the country from the rest of the world. The blocks have been intended to thwart dissent and prop up the country’s military rulers. Freedom of the press has also been severely restricted. But in an emergency like the earthquake, where power outages and infrastructure damage can already hinder access to the internet, such restrictions can further limit what information is available and can potentially affect the delivery of aid. Shortly after the quake, even the government struggled to stay online, as several official websites controlled by the junta were inaccessible. Myanmar’s military took power in a coup in 2021, seizing control of the country’s telecommunications networks, allowing it to shut down internet access in certain areas and create communications blackouts, according to Access Now, a digital rights organization. Despite widespread internet blocks, some areas have better connectivity than others. In regions where rebel groups have been fighting against the military, internet is particularly unreliable, with many using the satellite-based service Starlink to get online, said Joe Freeman, a Myanmar researcher at Amnesty International. The quake struck central Myanmar on Friday around 12:50 p.m. local time, causing damage in cities as far away as Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. The quake hit near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city after Yangon, and a strong aftershock was recorded shortly thereafter. Mr. Freeman said Myanmar’s internet blocks and censorship policies are surely having an effect on getting information about the extent of the disaster in the country. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Mr. Freeman said. The information black hole is a stark contrast to the reality of the country before the coup, when growing numbers of Facebook-addicted smartphone users posted huge amounts of memes, political debates and videos during previous crises, like the spread of Covid and protests against the military coup. A damaged roadway in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on Friday. Central Myanmar, the scene of a powerful earthquake on Friday, lies near the eastern end of one of the world’s most active zones of seismic activity: the Alpide Belt, which extends from the Mediterranean Sea eastward through Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan, then along the Himalayas to Myanmar and finally Indonesia. The epicenter of the quake on Friday was near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city with more than a million people. While much of Myanmar is susceptible to earthquakes, Mandalay and the surrounding towns sit right on top of one of four places in the country that are particularly prone to unusually powerful quakes, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Program. The other three places are in much less populated parts of the country. Large plates of the Earth’s crust are in motion in Myanmar. These plates are slowly grinding together. Underground rocks can become stuck for many years, before lurching up, down or sideways in strong earthquakes like the one on Friday. The plate on which India sits is gradually moving north and crunching underneath western China. That plate movement is pushing up the Himalayas, the world’s tallest mountain range. But the eastern edge of the Indian Plate is also bumping under the Burma Platelet, which holds Myanmar. The Burma Platelet is also in motion because the floor of the Andaman Sea, which lies between India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, is slowly widening. The complex interaction of these plates produces many fault lines across central and northern Myanmar, many of which are poorly understood and some of which have not even been named by geologists. Powerful earthquakes occur because of the movement of large plates of the Earth’s crust across the magma underneath. The speed of these plates varies, but they generally move as fast as a person’s fingernails grow. Rescue workers at the scene of a construction site in Bangkok, where a building collapsed on Friday. A building in Bangkok that had been under construction collapsed, killing at least eight people, while dozens of workers remained stuck in the rubble. The 33-floor skyscraper shook, and then in a flash it crumbled, its glass facade cascading down into a heap of rubble. Construction workers on the site scurried for safety as a massive dust cloud billowed out. On the street outside, people ran for cover, some jumping into cars and speeding away. At the construction site, in northern Bangkok, at least eight people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing as of Friday evening, according to Anutin Charnvirakul, a deputy prime minister. They were all presumed to be part of the 320-person crew of workers putting up a new building for the Thai government. About 70 people were taken to local hospitals. The rescue operation continued into the night as sniffer dogs searched for survivors. But the death toll was expected to rise. The nearby Chatuchak Park was being kept open through the night for people as a rest area, as were other parks — Benjakitti, Lumphini and Benjasiri. Traffic remained snarled hours after the earthquake hit and many people were unable to get home. Earlier in the day, throngs of panicked residents ran outside after Bangkok’s skyline swayed. Afterward, in central Bangkok, plazas and sidewalks were packed with crowds of office workers, shopkeepers and tourists who remained outside for fear of aftershocks and structural damage to the buildings. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Thailand declared Bangkok an “area of emergency,” asking residents to evacuate from tall buildings in case of aftershocks. Other videos showed water sloshing out of therooftop swimming poolof a high-rise hotel and spilling down the side of the building. The city’s elevated train, known as the Skytrain, was shut down and traffic on the city’s major arteries came to a virtual standstill as people tried to return home. Office towers, shopping malls and hotels evacuated their employees and guests while they conducted inspections to determine whether there had been damage before allowing them back inside. Pam Kershaw and her husband, tourists from Melbourne, Australia, were in their room on the 25th floor of the Athenee Hotel when the earthquake struck. The room began swaying and pictures banged against the walls. “It was very scary,” she said as she sat outside the hotel with hundreds of others waiting to go back inside. Sui-Lee Weecontributed reporting from Bangkok. Workers carrying an injured person near the site of the collapsed building. Chinesestate media reportedthat an unspecified number of people were injured and houses damaged in Ruili, a city in Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar. Ina videofrom Ruili shared by state media, a cloud of dust billowed from a tall building as people ran down the street away from it. Other videos shared widely online showed rubble in the streets. A Ruili residenttoldChinese official media that he had been riding his bicycle, when buildings and trees along the road began shaking. The resident, identified as Mr. Zhang, said that the beams of his home had cracked, and that the garages of some shopping malls had collapsed. Other videos showed light fixtures shaking in an apartment in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, nearly 500 miles away. China’s National Earthquake Data Centerwroteon social media that tremors were also felt in Guizhou and Guangxi, regions that do not border Myanmar. The aftershock that struck about 11 minutes after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake was stronger than initially thought. The U.S. Geological Survey, which originally reported that the aftershock’s magnitude was 6.4, has raised the level to 6.7. President Trump said Friday that the United States would provide assistance to Myanmar following the deadly earthquakes. “It’s a real bad one, and we will be helping,” he said in the Oval Office. “We’ve already spoken with the country”Emergency personnel continued to work after sundown at the scene of a collapsed building in northern Bangkok, where dozens were still missing. The United Nations said it had allocated an initial $5 million from its emergency fund to help life-saving operations in Myanmar and other areas impacted by the earthquake. Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the organization was gathering information to better guide its response and direct resources. He said the earthquake had worsened “an already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar, where nearly 20 million people need assistance across the country, including more than 3.5 million displaced from their homes.”The Myanmar military’s death toll of 144 is only from the three cities of Sagaing, Kyaukse, and Naypyidaw, suggesting that the total scaleislikely to be higher. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake toppled century-old stupas in a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, Shan State, just 70 miles from the epicenter. “Pindaya felt some earthquakes before but not so strong like today’s,” the monastery’s Facebook page administrator said by email, adding, “Most stupas are old ones and believed to be over 100 years old.”The photographs showed elaborate golden spires smashed on the ground, and red bricks strewn around the site. The foundations of other monuments and buildings were badly cracked. The earthquake severely damaged a Buddhist monastery in Pindaya, in Myanmar’s Shan State, about 70 miles from the epicenter. Several century-old stupas that adorned the religious site were toppled, photos obtained by The New York Times showed. And a witness video, geolocated by The Times to a street beside the monastery, captured the collapse of the largest of the golden stupas during an aftershock. Women wailed at the sight, as young Buddhist students exited the complex through a side gate. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said the U.N. system was mobilizing to help the people in need. In Mandalay, as the night deepened, terrified residents dragged their mattresses and mosquito nets out to the streets to sleep. Some planned to spend the night in their cars. Many were too scared to return to their homes. The population in the stricken region “resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,” the report said, adding that “recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as landslides.”The U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks seismic activity around the world, warned ina reporton Friday: “High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread.”Outside Mandalay General Hospital, patients keep streaming in. An ambulance siren wails, even after it stops to deliver a victim into the parking lot of the overwhelmed hospital. In Bangkok, at least seven people were confirmed dead and scores more were missing at a building that collapsed, as of Friday evening, according to the authorities. The military government in Myanmar said 144 people were dead and 732 injured. The agency warned that “the impact of the earthquake in Myanmar is likely to be severe, with possibly thousands of displaced people in need of urgent shelter, food and medical aid.” “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake, as communication network lines are down and transport is disrupted,” the group said. The International Rescue Committee says local media have reported at least 80 people were killed in Myanmar. One rescue worker in the city of Mandalay, Tun Min Latt, said the death toll had reached 86, with 60 those in Mandalay alone. The World Health Organization says it is looking at sending trauma supplies from its logistic hubs to support Myanmar. Myanmar has declared a state of emergency in six regions: Sagaing, Mandalay, Naypyidaw, Bago, Magway and Northeastern Shan State, according to Gen. Zaw Min Tun. In Bangkok, at the site of a building that had collapsed, an official told reporters that 70 people were still missing. A further 20 people were trapped in an elevator shaft, and it was unclear if they were alive. Outside the overwhelmed Mandalay General Hospital, there was chaos. Injured victims lay on stretchers, with their heads bandaged, moaning from the pain. There was a pool of blood. An ambulance siren wailed. When the vehicle stopped, two men carried a male victim down. General Zaw Min Tun said the government did not know the total number of casualties yet but that it was doing all it could to help the victims. The junta’s appeal for aid to the international community is extremely rare. In previous natural disasters, it has almost never asked for humanitarian aid. The call suggests that the authorities expect the death toll to be large. The Myanmar military spokesman, Gen. Zaw Min Tun, said, “we need and want the international community to provide humanitarian aid.” He added, “We will cooperate with them to ensure the best care for the victims.”The structure that collapsed was constructed in 2015, historical satellite imagery shows. Times journalists reported from the monastery in 2019; it was once attended by the infamous monk, Ashin Wirathu, who was jailed for hate speech directed against the Rohingya in Myanmar. In a striking Facebook video verified by The Times, Buddhist monks at the New Masoeyein monastery in Mandalay survey the remains of an ornate clock tower toppled by the powerful quake. As they look on, the multistory monastery building collapses before them. The head of Myanmar’s military junta, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, visited a 1,000-bed hospital in Naypyidaw, the country’s capital, after the earthquake. Dr. Kyaw Zin said there were so many injured people in the hospital that he had no space to set foot. Dr. Kyaw Zin, a doctor at the Mandalay General Hospital, said the death toll is now at 20, with at least 300 injured. “More injured people keep arriving, but we do not have enough doctors and nurses,” he said. “The cotton swabs have almost run out.”The number of injured in Myanmar is expected to rise. By late afternoon, more victims started turning up at the Mandalay General Hospital, arriving by ambulance, car and motorbike. Many of them were bleeding heavily."

For Some Autocrats, Even Rigged Elections Can Be Too Much of a ThreatProtests are raging in Turkey after the arrest of the country’s most prominent opposition politician. Over the last two decades, countries likeTurkey,HungaryVenezuelaandIndiagave the world a lesson on how democracy can erode into “competitive authoritarianism” — a system in which elections are still meaningful, but leaders manipulate the rules to their own benefit, while systematically violating civil liberties. Now, we are starting to find out what happens when even partial democracy becomes a significant threat to the authoritarians. Thelatest examplecomes from Turkey, whereprotests are raging across the country afterthe arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul and the country’s most prominent opposition politician. The government accused him of accepting bribes, rigging bids and misusing citizens’ personal data; he has denied the charges. (Istanbul University alsorescinded his diploma; holding a university degree is a requirement for Turkish presidential candidates.)Mr. Imamoglu’s growing popularity had made him a significant contender in Turkey’s next presidential election, and he was jailed pending his trial on the day of his party’s presidential primary. His arrest, experts say, sent a clear message that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is no longer willing to give the opposition a real chance to win elections. Mr. Erdogan seems to have recognized that even if he manipulates the system, he may not be able to beat Mr. Imamoglu, said Lisel Hintz, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University who studies Turkish politics. “So this move is an anticipatory move, trying to take the one individual who could potentially challenge Erdogan off the playing field,” she said. “This is really a clear shift from what we would call competitive authoritarianism to full authoritarianism.”Solving the authoritarian equationTurkish riot police officers standing guard as students rally in support of Mr. Imamoglu, in Istanbul, on Thursday. Turkey has not yet gone as far as countries like Russia, where there is little meaningful political opposition to President Vladimir Putin’s control. But many see the government’s actions as a significant step in that direction. To understand why this is happening, it is helpful to think about elections as a kind of equation of costs and benefits for authoritarian leaders to solve. On one side are the benefits of elections, which are oftenconsiderable, even for leaders who are not particularly invested in democratic freedoms. Winning them validates an authoritarian leader’s popularity and power, even if the election was not entirely free or fair. That not only bolsters the government’s legitimacy at home, but also its relationships with other countries. And it sends a powerful signal to elites in the country’s military, business community and other important constituencies that they should continue to support the government. On the other side of the equation is the obvious risk of holding competitive elections: The incumbent can lose. That appears to be what happened inlast year, for example, when President Nicolás Maduro’s efforts to secure his victory through behind-the-scenes manipulation failed, and his opponent won by a landslide, according to independent observers. Mr. Maduro then clumsily declared victory for himself anyway. In, events took a slightly different turn. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to weaken the opposition by arresting its leaders, cutting off their access to funds and limiting media freedom. In the end, his party lost its majority in parliament anyway. Mr. Modi remained prime minister, but must now govern in coalition with other parties, considerably limiting his power. The Trump effectIn Turkey, experts say that recent events have made it less attractive for Mr. Erdogan to allow competitive elections. The potential cost of a relatively open election grew as Mr. Imamoglu became more popular. Years of persistently high inflation, exacerbated by Mr. Erdogan’s economic policies, have also made many Turks angry. And the benefits of an open election shrank, largely because of the geopolitical ripple effects from the re-election of President Trump, said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in the Oval Office at the White House in 2019. The Trump administration does not appear to value the promotion of democracy abroad, and President Trumpseems to have an affinityfor authoritarian leaders like Mr. Putin. Additionally, waning U.S. support for NATO and defending Europe has made the continent more reliant on Turkey, which has the alliance’s second-biggest military and a flourishing defense industry. The result is that Mr. Erdogan has received very little criticism from allies in Europe and the United States who might once have opposed electoral manipulation or other undemocratic behavior. “President Erdogan has gambled on Turkey’s rising influence and leverage in this particular geopolitical climate, and he may be right about that,” Aydintasbas said. Authoritarian incompetenceIn Turkey, inflation and economic struggles have made it increasingly difficult for the government to maintain its popularity. That is due in part to the nature of competitive authoritarianism, which tends to reward loyalty over capability. “Incompetence makes it much more difficult to manage the economy in a way that would appeal to the people,” said Selim Erdem Aytac, a political scientist at Koc University in Istanbul. The government’s arrests of Mr. Imamoglu and other opposition politicians and journalists have triggered a significant backlash. Protests that first broke out on university campuses have now spiraled into the largest demonstrations the country has seen in more than a decade, despite a crackdown by the government. But it is not clear whether the protests have much capacity to make a difference. Years of democratic backsliding have insulated the government from many of the consequences of its heavy-handed rule. Such backsliding tends to be incremental and cumulative, which avoids triggering immediate public condemnation — but also makes that condemnation less effective when it eventually does come. “Once you are at a stage where you think, ‘Oh, that’s not acceptable,’ you don’t have the tools to prevent it,” Mr. Aytac said. “The judiciary is already captured. The media is already captured.”Advertisement will go here, if sold. A horizontal rule will appear above the ad by default.

"In Japan, an Iceless Lake and an Absent God Sound an Ancient Warning",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/japan-climate-lake.html,2025-03-28T04:01:11Z,World,"For centuries, residents in central Japan have chronicled a mysterious natural phenomenon in winter. They see its disappearance as a bad omen.",Global Warming; Winter (Season); Archives and Records; Ice,,Japan,,"Kiyoshi Miyasaka, a Shinto priest, has been observing Lake Suwa every winter for decades. Reporting from Suwa, JapanIn Japan, an Iceless Lake and an Absent God Sound an Ancient WarningFor centuries, residents in central Japan have chronicled a mysterious natural phenomenon in winter. They see its disappearance as a bad omen. For at least six centuries, residents along a lake in the mountains of central Japan have marked the depth of winter by celebrating the return of a natural phenomenon once revered as the trail of a wandering god. It would only appear after days of frigid temperatures had frozen Lake Suwa into a sheet of solid white. First, people were awakened at night by a loud rumbling. Dawn broke to reveal its source: a long, narrow ridge of jagged ice that had mysteriously arisen across the lake’s surface, meandering like the spiked back of a twisting dragon. This was the Miwatari, meaning the sacred crossing, which local belief held was left by a passing god of Japan’s native Shinto belief. Its appearance evoked feelings of awe but also reassurance among the residents, who ventured onto the ice to perform a ceremony honoring what they saw as a visitation from the supernatural. In the rare winters when the ice ridge did not appear, the god’s absence was viewed as a warning that the natural world was out of balance. Mr. Miyasaka leads parishioners from the Yatsurugi Shrine onto the frozen Lake Suwa in 2018, the last time the Miwatari formed. A photograph of the Miwatari taken in January 2006 displayed at the Yatsurugi Shrine. In some years, the ice spikes were taller than local residents. So important was the Miwatari that residents recorded whether it appeared, the condition of the lake and what historical events accompanied it. They have loyally written these descriptions every winter since 1443, creating a remarkable archive that attests to centuries of monotonously cold winters. But recently, the chronicles of Suwa have told a different, more alarming story. For the past seven winters, the Miwatari has failed to appear because the lake didn’t freeze. While there have been occasional years without ice, an absence of this length has happened only once before in the archive, and that was a half millennium ago. In fact, Lake Suwa has not fully frozen over — what locals call “an open sea” — for 18 of the past 25 years. Kiyoshi Miyasaka, the chief priest of Yatsurugi Shrine, which for the past three and a half centuries has borne the duty of maintaining the records, says ice has failed to appear with regularity since the 1980s. He and other locals blame the disappearance of the ancient rhythms on global climate change. “In old times, an open sea was regarded as a bad omen,” said Mr. Miyasaka, 74, whose shrine’s traditional stone gate and tile-roofed wooden buildings stand about a mile from the lakeshore. “We hear about melting of ice caps and Himalayan glaciers, but our own lake is also trying to alert us.”People skating and fishing on the frozen Lake Suwa in the late 1950s. The rhythm of life in winter is part of the local heritage cherished by residents. Every dawn through most of January and early February, Mr. Miyasaka and dozens of his parishioners gather at a parking lot on the lake’s edge to check if the god had passed by during the night. For years now, they have found only disappointment. Only parishioners in their 60s or older remember when the Miwatari was still big enough to make a sound that could wake them at night. The last time an ice ridge formed, in 2018, it was barely six inches tall. “When I was child, the ice spikes rose higher than my height,” said Isao Nakazawa, 81, a retired auto company worker. “We knew when it appeared because it made a sound like a taiko drum, ‘Gon-gon-gon!’”These days, the Miwatari has lost much of its religious significance. Residents in Suwa, a small, sleepy city wrapped along the lake’s edge, see it as a local rite of winter. The city’s mayor joins the gatherings on cold mornings alongside the lake. “Carrying on a tradition for 580 years binds our community together,” said the mayor, Yukari Kaneko, 66. “I fear what’s happening now is a warning to rethink how we’re living.”Residents in Suwa, a small city wrapped along the lake’s edge, always looked forward to the return of the Miwatari as a local rite of winter. Science has also robbed the ice ridges of their mystery by explaining how they arise. When Lake Suwa freezes, its surface hardens into a slab some two and a half miles across. On particularly cold nights, the ice contracts, opening cracks that fill with lake water, which also freezes. As temperatures rise again, the slab expands back into its original shape, pushing the newly formed ice upward into buckled ramparts. Similar ice ridges appear elsewhere, including onLake Mendota in Wisconsin. But records rarely go back so far or in such detail as in Suwa. “This chronicle is quite special because the people have recorded the same thing in the same way for centuries,” saidDagomar Degroot, a professor of environmental history at Georgetown University. “It’s an example of a cultural heritage that is slipping away and may not come back.”While Mr. Miyasaka says he feels discouraged by the failure of the ice ridge to return, he intends to keep updating the archive. “You cannot just quit something that has been around for more than 580 years,” said Mr. Miyasaka, whose family has held the position of chief priest for five generations. “I will not be the one who ends it.”“In old times, an open sea was regarded as a bad omen,” said Mr. Miyasaka. His parishioners say they will continue to join him in checking the lake on winter mornings. “I feel a responsibility to keep this history going,” Hiroyuki Okazaki, a 63-year-old carpenter, said. Neither Mr. Miyasaka nor his parishioners say they believe that they have actually been abandoned by a god — Japan has become far too secular for that. They don’t even know which god was supposed to be crossing the lake. The ancient records don’t give a name, and Shinto is a form of animism that believes in countless gods that lie behind the forces of nature. In modern times, a tale appeared of a male god crossing the lake to visit his wife, but Mr. Miyasaka said this was the work of enterprising local business owners using romance to draw tourists. Some locals also add an extra “o” to the front of Miwatari to make the word sound more contemporary, he said. The chief priest has read through all of the chronicle’s entries, including the oldest now stored in a museum. Most of the pages, written with brushes and ink and bound in hand-sewn books, tell of the Miwatari appearing with comforting regularity. During the entire 17th century, the ice ridge failed to appear only twice. In 1986, his father taught him how to perform the ceremony to honor the Miwatari’s appearance, in which he led parishioners onto the frozen lake and waved a holly branch as the ice creaked beneath their feet. At the time, Mr. Miyasaka assumed he would have to do this every year. Instead, he’s led the ceremony only nine times since then. “When our ancestors made these records centuries ago, they never imagined they would tell such a story,” Mr. Miyasaka said. “They have become a warning of global warming.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

"Pope Francis Came Near Death in Hospital, His Doctor Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/pope-francis-doctor-interview.html,2025-03-28T04:01:05Z,World,"In an interview, the leader of Pope Francis’s medical team called it “a miracle” that the 88-year-old pontiff left the hospital, but said he needs to change his vigorous habits, at least for a while, to recover.",Popes,Francis,,"Roman Catholic Church; Gemelli Hospital (Rome, Italy)","Dr. Sergio Alfieri, chief surgeon at Agostino Gemelli hospital in Rome, led the team that treated Pope Francis there for 38 days. He spoke at a news conference on Saturday. Reporting from RomePope Francis Came Near Death in Hospital, His Doctor SaysIn an interview, the leader of Pope Francis’s medical team called it “a miracle” that the 88-year-old pontiff left the hospital, but said he needs to change his vigorous habits, at least for a while, to recover. The pope’s doctors did not think he was going to make it. “It’s terrible,” Pope Francis gasped duringa breathing crisislast month. The pope, his hand bruised with needle pricks and his oxygen saturation dipping to a dangerously low 78 during his long hospitalization, acknowledged in a failing voice that he might die. He held his doctor’s hand. Francis had ruled out intubation, which would mean being kept unconscious, the leader of the medical team, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, said in an interview. So his doctors decided to treat the pneumonia in both his lungs with a last-ditch barrage of drugs that risked damaging his organs. The pope’s closest aides had tears in their eyes as doctors asked the pope’s personal nurse, empowered to make life-or-death decisions, for permission to go ahead with more aggressive treatment. He consented and, ultimately, the pope responded positively. Even so, the worst had not yet passed. Less than a week later, Francisregurgitatedsome food and started choking. The doctors, fearing he might die on the spot, immediately suctioned his airway but worried that the inhalation would aggravate his deeply infected lungs. His chief doctor worried all was lost. But it was not. On Sunday 38 days after heentered the Agostino Gemelli hospital, Dr. Alfieri discharged the leader of the Roman Catholic Church to return to the Vatican. He implored his patient, who had resisted going to the hospital in the first place, to rest and convalesce so as not to waste the chance he had been given. “It was a miracle that he left the hospital,” said Dr. Alfieri, adding that the pope was now “not in danger.”But when Francis made abrief appearance over the weekend, the public received a sobering glimpse of the toll the health crisis had taken on the 88-year-old pope. Greeting well-wishers from a hospital balcony, his voice was so weak it bordered on inaudible, his breathing so strained it sometimes looked like he gasped for air. Pope Francis’s first public appearance since he was hospitalized, addressing a crowd from a hospital balcony on Sunday, showed how weakened he was. “You can see the decline,” Carlos Aguirre, a pilgrim from Colorado Springs said as he watched Francis struggle to speak. Francis’ doctor said the pope agreed to a two-month convalescence that would put him on the road to full recovery. But prelates close to Francis are guarding against the possibility that his frail state is really the new normal. They have depicted his physical weakness as a powerful teaching moment about human dignity, and argued that his evident lack of energy has no bearing on his authority, even if it temporarily loosened his hands-on style of governance. Over the next two months, Francis will be less visible, harder to hear, more cloistered and more likely to stick to the script. The constraints, Vatican experts and officials say, will be a challenge for Francis, who, over the last dozen years, made far-flung travel, physical closeness to his flock, dramatic gestures and a freewheeling style the hallmarks of his pontificate. Those touchstones of Francis’ papacy will now be on hold. The Vatican said on Thursday that the pope’s participation in Easter rites in a special Jubilee year is uncertain, depending on his improvement. Buckingham Palace announced that King Charles III had postponed a Vatican visit, “as medical advice has now suggested that Pope Francis would benefit from an extended period of rest and recuperation.” A papal schedule once packed with appearances has given way to written statements and remarks. “Nothing will be as scintillating as it was before,” Alberto Melloni, a church historian and the director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Sciences in Bologna, said of Francis’ convalescence. Dr. Alfieri said he instructed the pope to keep to his Vatican residence, which would be outfitted with oxygen but no other special equipment, and Francis agreed. He implored the pope to avoid large groups and especially exposure to small children, for fear of new infection. During that time, he will take oral medications in the hopes of definitively curing his lung infection. He said the pope could work but should not overly exert himself for the time being. Nuns waited for the seating area to be opened for a Rosary service for Pope Francis in St. Peter’s Square last month. “His voice will return as before,” as Francis’ respiratory muscles strengthen, Dr. Alfieri said. Anything could happen given the pope’s age and history of illness, he said — Francis has had respiratory ailments throughout his life, including one that required removal of part of a lung when he was a young man. But the doctor said he expected that over time, Francis could increase his workload as long as his health held. Vatican analysts said that while the pope has been lying low, he runs the church as before. “He is able to command even from a bed,” said Sandro Magister, a veteran Vatican watcher. “Knowing his character, he would react quite harshly to any attempt to keep him, let’s say, under control.”Some of Francis’ allies in the Church hierarchy went further, saying his frailty was a new attribute that would allow him to embody his own teachings. “People say he doesn’t speak, he doesn’t speak with his mouth,” Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said while introducing a summit on longevity at the Vatican. The pope’s condition amounted to a “deafening voice” for the reality of human limits and the dignity of old age, he added. “We have to get out of an overly functionalist mind-set.”Much the same was saidtwo decades agoof Pope John Paul II as he deteriorated in public view, his body hunched and trembling, his head slumped to one side. It is likely to become an increasingly common theme as popes, like everyone else, live longer, a societal change that prompted theVatican’s summit this week on longevity. Francis’ predecessor, Benedict XVI, stepped down at 85, citing his age and frailty — and then lived another decade. Weeks after Francis came close to death, his gradual improvement was a relief to his doctors and the Roman Catholic faithful. Dr. Alfieri said that when the treatment started working and the pope’s health improved, his humor did too. He had his staff order pizza for the hospital floor, and went into the halls so that his fellow patients could see him and have a shared sense of their common vulnerability. When it came time for Francis to leave, and he changed in his room into his white cassock and zucchetto, Dr. Alfieri was not just the pope’s physician. “To see the pope,” he said, “who was dressed as a patient in pajamas, and then to see him again dressed as pope, is certainly, for a Catholic, an enormous feeling.”Elisabetta Povoledocontributed reporting from Rome.

Agents in Southeast Asia Paid for Sex While Police Stood By, Watchdog Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/americas/fbi-agents-in-southeast-asia-used-prostitutes-watchdog-says.html,2025-03-28T00:34:05Z,World,"Solicitation of prostitutes took place over several years even as employees were training to combat human trafficking, according to a document released to The Times in a lawsuit.",Prostitution,,,Federal Bureau of Investigation,"The report describes F.B.I. employees paying for or accepting sex while socializing with each other and with the police. F.B.I. Agents in Southeast Asia Paid for Sex While Police Stood By, Watchdog SaysSolicitation of prostitutes took place over several years even as employees were training to combat human trafficking, according to a document released to The Times in a lawsuit. F.B.I. agents stationed overseas had sex with prostitutes in Cambodia, the Philippines and Thailand, even as some bureau employees attended training meant to combat human trafficking, a practice that often exploits vulnerable women, according to an investigation by the Justice Department’s watchdog. The document, made public on Thursday in response to a lawsuit by The New York Times, covers activity from 2009 to 2018, and describes F.B.I. employees paying for or accepting sex while socializing with each other and with the police in several countries, portraying a lascivious culture where women were freely used for sex. The previously unreleased information gives the fullest picture to date of damning conduct by F.B.I. agents abroad, resolving some of the unanswered questions from a scandal that began under the first Trump administration and was largely kept quiet for years as government lawyers argued against disclosing details. They come as the new F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, has promised to remake the bureau. Prostitution is prevalent in Cambodia, the Philippines and Thailand but illegal in all three countries. The F.B.I., which has made combating sex trafficking a priority, prohibits employees from paying for sex. “The F.B.I. took swift action once alerted to the behavior,” the bureau said in a statement. “Everyone who engaged in this inexcusable behavior was held accountable and no longer works for the F.B.I.” The agency added that it had since changed its selection process and training for personnel assigned overseas. Some of the activity happened when officials were in other countries for conferences or events. In 2017, F.B.I. officials visiting Bangkok for an event twice went to bars where they negotiated for sex in the company of the police, the report says. That same year, the Royal Thai Policeco-hosted atraining course with the F.B.I. and Homeland Security Investigations, a law enforcement agency within the Homeland Security Department, on combating human trafficking. It is unclear whether the F.B.I. employees solicited sex during the anti-trafficking training or during another event. On the sidelines of another event, in Manila in 2018, F.B.I. employees accepted prostitutes paid for by a local law enforcement agency, the report says. The Wall Street Journalreported in 2018that several F.B.I. employees had been recalled from cities across Asia while the inspector general investigated alleged contact with prostitutes and other accusations. In 2021, the inspector general’s office posted a briefsummary of its inquiry, noting that five employees had solicited sex while overseas, and that one of them had also given a colleague “a package containing approximately 100 white pills to deliver to a foreign law enforcement officer.”The report makes clear that several violations happened when multiple F.B.I. employees were present. An outing to a karaoke bar turned seedy when the employees were given room keys or numbered papers corresponding to hotel rooms. At least one of the employees on that outing was a supervisor. At one point, two employees engaged in sex acts with prostitutes while sharing a room, the report says. After The Times sued for the internal report in 2023, the Justice Department under both the Biden and Trump administrations fought to keep the information secret, arguing that publishing details could violate employees’ privacy. Last year, the Justice Department released a highly redacted version of the document. It released a more complete report on Thursday only after a federal judge in the Southern District of New York had ordered it to do so. The five employees who solicited sex resigned, retired, or were removed during the oversight agency’s investigation. The F.B.I. is not the first U.S. law enforcement agency to come under scrutiny for the exploits of its staff while overseas. In 2012, the Secret Service was roiled by aprostitution scandalinvolving around a dozen agents in Colombia. In 2015, the Justice Department’s inspector general disclosed that Drug Enforcement Administration agents, again in Colombia, had participated in sex parties with prostitutes paid for by drug cartels over a span of several years. That reportprompted a congressional investigationandwas swiftly followed by the retirementof the Obama administration’s top drug official. Amid the scrutiny, Attorney General Eric Holder published amemorandumprohibiting employees from soliciting prostitution, even when legal or tolerated in a foreign country. The practice, he said, “undermines the department’s efforts to eradicate the scourge of human trafficking.” Several of the employees in Asia violated that order, the recent report notes. The Justice Department inspector general is tasked with investigating and auditing the department’s programs and documenting abuses by its personnel. President Trump has had a contentious relationship with such oversight agencies. Days after taking office in January, he fired 12 inspectors general from other agencies, though the Justice Department’s inspector general was spared.

King Charles Briefly Hospitalized After Side Effects From Cancer Treatment,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/europe/king-charles-hospital-cancer-treatment-engagements.html,2025-03-27T21:28:45Z,World,Buckingham Palace said that Charles experienced “temporary side effects” following treatment on Thursday and was taken to the hospital for observation before returning to his London residence.,Royal Families; Cancer,"Charles III, King of the United Kingdom",Great Britain; Europe,,"King Charles III during a visit to Scotland last year. Reporting from LondonKing Charles Briefly Hospitalized After Side Effects From Cancer TreatmentBuckingham Palace said that Charles experienced “temporary side effects” following treatment on Thursday and was taken to the hospital for observation before returning to his London residence. King Charles III was briefly hospitalized on Thursday after suffering side effects from hiscancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said in a statement. The palace said Charles, 76, had since returned to his London residence, Clarence House, and that his public schedule for Friday would be canceled as a precaution. The king announced in February last year that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer, and he has been undergoing treatment since then. The palace did not specify the nature of the side effects, beyond saying they were temporary and “required a short period of observation in hospital.”Charles has returned to an active schedule in recent months, playing host to foreign leaders including President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and visiting an aircraft carrier, the H.M.S. Prince of Wales. But the palace has offered no updates on his prognosis or the nature of his treatment. His cancer was discovered during surgery for an enlarged prostate last February; the palace has said that he does not have prostate cancer but has offered no other details about his illness. That is in contrast to his daughter-in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, who also was diagnosed with cancer last year, but announced in January that after several months of chemotherapy, she was nowcancer free. King Charles and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine earlier this month, at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. The palace sought to play down concerns about the king’s condition, saying that his recovery continued on a positive track and that the side effects were not unusual for patients receiving medication. Palace officials said they did not expect Charles to make major changes to his schedule, which has included regular foreign and domestic travel. The king, for example, plans to go ahead with a state visit to Italy next month. The palace announced earlier this week that he and his wife, Queen Camilla, would not visit Pope Francis at the Vatican because Francis is stillrecovering from pneumoniaand a severe respiratory illness, which kept him hospitalized for more than a month. “His Majesty was due to receive credentials from the ambassadors of three different nations this afternoon,” the palace said in a statement. “Tomorrow, he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion.”“He very much hopes that they can be rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible,” the statement said. Concerns about the king’s health have faded in recent months, as he has kept up a vigorous schedule, including a demanding nine-day tour ofAustraliaand Samoa last year. But the dearth of information about his treatment or prognosis has made it difficult to gauge whether he is recovering swiftly or simply pushing himself. The palace did not rule out further minor adjustments to his schedule, which it said would be made in consultation with his doctors. Officials emphasized that the king relished his public duties and that they contributed to his well-being. Charles has found himself in the center of a diplomatic swirl in recent weeks. Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivered aformal invitationfrom the king for President Trump to make a state visit to Britain during his meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Several days later, after Mr. Trump clashed bitterly with Mr. Zelensky, the king played host to the Ukrainian president at his country residence, Sandringham. Mr. Zelensky had traveled to Britain after the United States to attend a meeting of European and other leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. Charles also met with two successive prime ministers of Canada, Justin Trudeau and Mark Carney, while they were wrestling with tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump and rejecting his call for Canada to become the 51st American state. Such meetings are commonplace, given that Charles is also the king of Canada. But they took on added significance in light of the deepening tensions between Canada and the United States. Even the king’s visit to an aircraft carrier, during which he spoke to the crew and watched fighter jets take off and land on the deck, was laden with symbolism. Britain, along with France, has taken a leading role in trying to assemble a multinational force to help secure a peace settlement in Ukraine. Can pollution cause cancer? What about inflammation?

Reporting from ParisProsecutors Seek 7-Year Sentence for Nicolas Sarkozy in Libya TrialThe former French president has been convicted before, but the charge that he took illegal campaign funding from the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi has been the most damaging to his legacy. French prosecutors requested a seven-year prison sentence against former PresidentNicolas Sarkozyon Thursday, in a trial over accusations that his 2007 campaign received illegal financing from the Libyan government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Such a sentence would be unprecedented in modern French history for a former president. Mr. Sarkozy, a conservative politician who led France from 2007 to 2012, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and judges at the Paris courtwhere he has been on trial since Januarymay or may not follow the prosecution’s request if he is found guilty. His lawyers are expected to lay out their closing arguments next month, and the court is expected to defer its verdict to a later date. The severity of the sentence request showed that the Libya case isa far more serious threatto Mr. Sarkozy’s legacy than his many other legal entanglements, some of which have alreadyresulted in convictions. In addition to prison time, prosecutors also requested that Mr. Sarkozy, 70, pay a fine of 300,000 euros, or about $340,000; that he be barred from running for office, and that he be stripped of certain civic rights. Mr. Sarkozy, who no longer holds public office but retainssome political influence, lashed out against the sentencing recommendations on Thursday, saying in astatementon social media that the “falseness and violence of the accusations and the outrageousness of the sentence demanded” aimed to “mask the weakness” of the prosecution’s case. The Libya case issprawling, convoluted and explosive, involving accusations that Mr. Sarkozy’s campaign illegally accepted funding from Mr. el-Qaddafi, the former Libyan strongman who was killed by opposition fighters in 2011. Mr. Sarkozy is accused of taking illegal campaign financing from the Libyan strongman Muammar el-Qaddafi. They appeared together in front of the Bab Azizia palace, Mr. Qaddafi’s home at the time, in Tripoli, Libya in July 2007. Mr. Sarkozy is facing charges of illegal campaign financing, criminal conspiracy, concealing the misappropriation of public funds and passive corruption (a charge that applies to people suspected of receiving money or favors). Over the past few days, prosecutors who specialize in financial crimes depicted Mr. Sarkozy as the key decision maker in an “unthinkable, unprecedented, obscene corruption pact” with the Qaddafi government, involving a complex web of political and financial ties between Mr. Sarkozy’s advisers, Libyan officials and businessmen or bankers who acted as intermediaries. Twelve other people are alsostanding trialon similar charges, and prosecutors have requested sentences ranging from one to six years in prison and fines of up to four million euros. Since 1945, only one other former French head of state has been found guilty by a court of law: Jacques Chirac, who wasconvicted in 2011of a less striking form of corruption, misusing public funds when he was mayor of Paris, and was given a suspended sentence. Mr. Sarkozy has faced multiple accusations of financial impropriety since he left office, although that has done little to dent his popularity with the base of his conservative party or to prevent hismemoirsfromflying off the shelves. Some of the cases have beendropped. But in 2021, he wasconvictedof trying to obtain information from a judge about a court case against him and is currently serving one year under a form of house arrest with an electronic bracelet. He was alsoin 2021 for illegally financing hisunsuccessful 2012 re-electioncampaign, which wildly exceeded France’s spending limits.

Reporting from Georgetown, Guyana, and Paramaribo, Suriname, while traveling with Secretary of State Marco RubioRubio Vows ‘Consequences’ if Venezuela Tries Seizing Territory From GuyanaSecretary of State Marco Rubio was visiting Guyana amid ExxonMobil’s oil production there. Venezuela has asserted claims to a large region of the country. Mr. Rubio later flew to Suriname. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that there would be “consequences” if Venezuela used forceful actions in asserting claims to resource-rich territories that are under the control of neighboring Guyana. Mr. Rubio said at a news conference in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital, that the U.S. government would steadfastly oppose “the regional threats based on illegitimate territorial claims by a narco-trafficking regime.”“There will be consequences for adventurism,” he said as he stood on a stage with Irfaan Ali, the president of Guyana, a small country along the northern coast of South America. “There will be consequences for aggressive actions, and that’s why our partnership in that regard will be important.”In recent years, Venezuela has intensified claims to the Essequibo region that makes up about two-thirds of Guyana and includes the oil-rich offshore waters where ExxonMobil is leading oil production. Mr. Rubio said he would not specify what the Trump administration would be prepared to do against Venezuela, but pointed out the power and size of the U.S. Navy, implying the United States could take military action. Mr. Rubio and Hugh Todd, Guyana’s foreign minister, signed a memorandum of understanding on security cooperation before the news conference. “I’m very pleased at the reassurance of the U.S. at ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Mr. Ali said. On March 1, Mr. Alidenouncedwhat he called an illegal incursion by a Venezuelan naval vessel into waters near where Exxon is leading a group of companies in extraction. “This is a serious development concerning our nation’s maritime territory,” he said on television. “We will not tolerate threats to territorial integrity.”The U.S. State Department expressed support for Guyana and warned Venezuela’s government in a social media post against “further provocation.”The vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, said at the time that Mr. Ali was telling “baldfaced lies” and that Exxon’s oil-producing operations were illegal. Exxon discovered the oil reserves in 2015. The Essequibo region is also coveted for its gold, bauxite, diamond, uranium, manganese and other minerals. Bartica, Essequibo, is the gateway to what the Guyanese call “the interior,” a sparsely populated region of forest and savanna that is rich in natural resources. On Monday, President Trump said he would impose a 25 percent tariff on any country that buys oil from Venezuela. Mr. Rubio’s stop in Guyana was the first of two on Thursday during a three-nation tour of the Caribbean and South America. He had been in Jamaica, where he met with the prime minister, and later on Thursday flew to Suriname. Both Guyana and Suriname are oil-rich countries, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have stressed the U.S. need for energy security, including through greater fossil fuel production, despite concerns among scientists about a deepening climate crisis. In January, Mr. Trumpwithdrew the United Statesfrom the Paris Agreement on climate change. He did the same in his first term, but the United States re-entered the pact under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. On Tuesday, the day before Mr. Rubio left for his trip, the Trump administration’s special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, noted that Guyana was on the verge of becoming the largest per capita oil producer in the world, surpassing Qatar and Kuwait. “It’s seen as some of the greatest offshore opportunities in the world,” he told reporters. “The security of Guyana is a key priority for us in the same way that we have been working with countries in the Gulf States to ensure the security cooperation from the regional threats there.”“We’ve seen the threats from Venezuela,” he added. “We’ve seen the approaches towards Exxon facilities. Obviously, that’s unacceptable, and we want to work together and find an agreement towards binding security cooperation.”For many years, the U.S. government has maintained a hostile stance toward the government of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. The first Trump administration imposed broad sanctions on the country and tried to support an opposition leader,Juan Guaidó, in his bid to unseat Mr. Maduro. At the time, Mr. Rubio, then a U.S. senator representing Florida,promoted policiesaimed at deposing Mr. Maduro in favor of Mr. Guaidó. After adisputed presidential electionlast year that Mr. Maduro is widely believed to have stolen, Mr. Biden recognized the opposition candidate, Edmundo González, as the legitimate winner. A reporter from Guyana pressed Mr. Rubio on what the United States would do if the Venezuelan military were to strike Guyana or ExxonMobil. “It would be a very bad day for the Venezuelan regime if they were ever to attack Guyana or attack ExxonMobil,” Mr. Rubio said. “It would be a very bad day, a very bad week for them.”An audience of Guyanese officials clapped. Mr. Rubio landed soon afterward in Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname, and met with the country’s president, Chan Santokhi, in the airport around 5 p.m. Mr. Santokhi and Mr. Rubio told reporters that they had discussed greater cooperation on Suriname’s growing energy industry, which is centered on oil. Mr. Santokhi said economic partnerships among Guyana, Suriname and the United States could play a “crucial role” in the region.

"Four Tesla Dealers Said They Sold 8,653 Cars in 3 Days in Canada. Did They?",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/canada/tesla-canada-sales-musk.html,2025-03-27T20:01:39Z,World,The sales numbers provided by the company-owned shops allowed them to claim tens of millions in government rebates.

Reporting from OttawaFour Tesla Dealers Said They Sold 8,653 Cars in 3 Days in Canada. Did They? The sales numbers provided by the company-owned shops allowed them to claim tens of millions in government rebates. Now those numbers are under scrutiny. As in many places around the world, Tesla sales in Canada have been falling for months, an apparent reaction to Elon Musk’s outsize role in the Trump administration and his repeated denigration of Canadian sovereignty. Yet somehow, four Tesla-owned dealerships reported to the Canadian government that they sold an astonishing 8,653 cars during a single weekend in January — enough to qualify for 43 million Canadian dollars’ (about $30 million) worth of government subsidies under a program just before it expired. Now the Canadian government wants to know exactly how the electric carmaker managed to move two cars a minute off its lots — a rate that assumes those four dealers had stayed open 24 hours from Jan. 10 to Jan. 12. Those payments were frozen this month after Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister and named a new transport minister who ordered officials “to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid.” The minister, Chrystia Freeland, said that “no payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid.”The subsidy program has expired, but Ms. Freeland, taking aim at the Trump administration, said that if there was a new one, Teslas would not be eligible “so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”Tesla’s gain was a loss for some of its competitors. The company’s breathtaking flurry of sales claims for some of its dealers in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec drained funds from the government’s rebate program, bringing it to a close before its scheduled March 31 end date. As a result, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association estimates, 225 dealers selling other brands were unable to claim about 10 million in Canadian dollars, putting some of them in financial peril. “When you’re looking at a 43 million dollar hit over a weekend, an investigation is definitely warranted,” said Huw Williams, a spokesman for the dealers’ association. “The level of transactions just does not make common sense.’’Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The Toronto Star first reported the sales rush claims, which were posted on a government website that tracks rebate payments. Under the government plan, which began in 2019, dealers deducted rebates of up to 5,000 Canadian dollars when they sold electric vehicles before reporting the purchase information — including buyers’ names and the vehicles’ identification numbers — to the government for reimbursement. The torrent of Tesla claims started on Jan. 10 after Transport Canada warned dealers across the country that the program would run out of money before the end of March. By Monday morning, the account was empty and the program was closed. About 1,000 dealers selling other brands submitted claims over that weekend but Tesla accounted for about 88 percent of the applications. “How did Tesla magically know to hit that number?” Mr. Williams asked, referring to the draining of the rebate program’s remaining funds. While some dealers stacked up claims before submitting them to the government, Mr. Williams said, the Tesla surge “doesn’t fit any pattern for Tesla going backwards.”He also said that it was physically impossible for the four Tesla dealerships to keep thousands of cars on hand. Mr. Williams said that Ms. Freeland told his group that dealers who missed out after Tesla emptied the fund would ultimately be reimbursed, but that how long that might take was unclear. Tesla has become a particularsource of anger among Canadians since President Trump began imposing tariffs on Canada and calling for Canada to become the 51st state. Annexation has also been championed by Mr. Musk, who holds Canadian citizenship and lived in Canada before moving to the United States. An online petition calling on the Canadian government to revoke Mr. Musk’s citizenship has drawn hundreds of thousands of signatures. More than 80 Teslas were vandalized, their tires punctured and their paint scratched at a dealer in Hamilton, Ontario, this month. A Tesla outlet in Montreal was defaced with pink paint. And in Vancouver, organizers of an auto show banned the company over concerns about possible protests and vandalism. Four Canadian provinces have excluded Tesla from their electric vehicle rebate programs this year. At least one Tesla competitor has been trying to cash in on the antipathy. Polestar, the Swedish -based, Chinese-controlled EV maker, is offering Canadians a 5,000 Canadian dollar discount if they can prove that they are registered Tesla owners. Tesla’s Global Sales Slump: Elon Musk’s involvement in right-wing politics contributed to a13 percent drop in deliveries in the first quarter, including steep declines in E.V.-friendly places like Norway. Fatal Crash in China: A popular electric vehicle made by the Chinese consumer electronics giant Xiaomi crashed into a concrete guardrailwhile deploying its autonomous driving feature.

Algerian French Writer Is Sentenced to 5-Year Prison Term in Algeria,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/africa/algeria-boualem-sansal-prison-france.html,2025-03-27T17:57:23Z,World,"The prosecution of Boualem Sansal, who is around 80, prompted outrage from the global literary community and pleas from France for his release.",Prisons and Prisoners; Freedom of Speech and Expression,"Sansal, Boualem",Algeria; France,,"A demonstration in support of Boualem Sansal in Paris on Tuesday. Algerian French Writer Is Sentenced to 5-Year Prison Term in AlgeriaThe prosecution of Boualem Sansal, who is around 80, prompted outrage from the global literary community and pleas from France for his release. An Algerian French writer whose arrest in Algeria on accusations of undermining national unity and security inflamed tensions with France was sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday. The writer, Boualem Sansal, who was born in Algeria and became a French citizen last year, was arrested in November because of statements he made to French news media siding with Morocco in a territorial dispute with Algeria. His detention raised an outcry from other authors worldwide, and his sentencing came after months of pleas for his freedom from the French president, Emmanuel Macron. France was once Algeria’s colonial ruler. Mr. Sansal was tried and sentenced without being allowed access to legal counsel, according to his lawyer in France, Francois Zimeray. “Cruel detention, 20 minutes of hearing, a forbidden defense and ultimately five years in prison for an innocent writer,” Mr. Zimeray said in a statement. The sentence, he said, “betrays the very meaning of the word justice.”Mr. Sansal, who was diagnosed with cancer and is believed to be about 80, is being held at Kolea prison, outside the capital, Algiers, according to Mr. Zimeray. “His age and his state of health make each day of incarceration even more inhumane,” the lawyer said. “I appeal to the Algerian president: Justice has failed, at least let humanity prevail.”Mr. Sansal in Paris in 2015. His lawyer has appealed to the United Nations to take a stand on the writer’s case. Mr. Zimeray said in a text message that the next steps in the case were not clear but that the coming weeks might be decisive. “It’s in the hands of the Algerian government,” he said. Mr. Macron echoed the sentiment. Speaking to reporters ata briefingon Thursday, he called Mr. Sansal a “great writer” and, noting his poor health, urged his release. “I know I can count on the humanity of the Algerian authorities,” the French president said before adding: “In any case, I very much hope so.”Mr. Macron has been taking a more conciliatory tone sinceaccusing Algeriain January of dishonoring itself with Mr. Sansal’s detention. This month, Mr. Sansal’s lawyer appealed to the United Nations to take a stand in the matter. He called the writer’s detention arbitrary and said that it had occurred in a “larger context” of widespread denial of freedom of expression and the weaponization of the Algerian justice system. After Mr. Sansal was arrested upon his arrival in Algeria last year, his case drew condemnation from French lawmakers and intellectuals, as well as writers around the world. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature, including Annie Ernaux and Orhan Pamuk, and other noted authors like Salman Rushdie joined an opinion article by the French Algerian writer Kamel Daoud inLe Pointnewsmagazine, denouncing  “editorial terrorism” in Algeria. Repression of Algerian journalists hasbeen increasingin recent years. In 2019, mass protests forced Algeria’s president from power. His replacement, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who was elected with military support, has pushed the country toward harsher authoritarianism. Dozens of journalists are believed to have been imprisoned in Algeria as the government has sought to prevent mass protests from flaring again, though the figures are murky given the difficulty of independent reporting, experts say. A banner in support of the writer on a bridge in Béziers, in southern France, on Wednesday. Mr. Sansal has long been outspoken about his opposition to Islamism and critical of the Algerian government. In 2012, he wasdenied the cash portion of a prizeby the Arab Ambassadors Council in Paris after attending awriters festival in Jerusalem. The statements he made that led to his detention came at a particularly fraught time for relations between France and Algeria. In October, Mr. Macron told Moroccan lawmakers he believed that Western Sahara — subject of a territorial dispute between Algeria and Morocco, a former French protectorate — should be under Moroccan sovereignty, angering Algerians. Mr. Sansal had also said that Algeria benefited from French colonization because it gained territory in the Western Sahara that once belonged to the kingdom of Morocco. Mr. Sansal, who had been working as an engineer for the Algerian government, published his first book, “The Oath of the Barbarians,” in 1999. The novel was critical of Islamic fundamentalism and government repression, putting Mr. Sansal out of a job and paving the way for a second career as a writer and commentator.

Gazans Demand End to 18 Years of Hamas RuleMost protests have been small, but they represent the boldest challenge to the group’s authority by Palestinians since the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the ensuing war. When an Israeli airstrike ripped through a building in central Beit Lahia on Monday night, the farming community in the northernmost part of Gaza was already on edge over an Israeli evacuation order hours earlier. The events shook the town’s residents and reminded them of the perils of the war between Israel and Hamas, but they also helped catalyze rare demonstrations against Hamas in Gaza. For three consecutive days, hundreds of peoplehave marchedthrough the town to demand the end both of the war and of Hamas’s 18-year-old rule over Gaza — public protests that have spread to a number of other towns in the battered enclave. “Hamas needs to go away,” said Ahmad al-Masri, 26, a resident of Beit Lahia who helped call for the demonstrations. “If it doesn’t, the bloodshed, the wars and the destruction won’t stop.”Palestinians marching in Beit Lahia on Wednesday. While most of the demonstrations have been small, they represent the boldest challenge to Hamas’s authority by Palestinians in Gaza since the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 2023 and the ensuing war, which has reduced cities to rubble. They also embody the frustration of Palestinians who are again living throughdeadly and ear-shattering bombingafter Israel and Hamas failed to reach an agreement to extend the cease-fire. They make clear that at least some Palestinians have put aside their fears about potential retribution by Hamas, which has governed Gaza with a heavy hand. “We don’t have anything to lose,” said Mr. al-Masri. “We have already lost our lives, homes and money.”Before the 2023 attack, Hamas brutally clamped down on Palestinians protesting the miserable living conditions in Gaza and conducted reconnaissance on protest organizers. But during the latest protests, Hamas’s internal security forces have largely refrained from cracking down. That, analysts said, was likely a reflection of both Hamas’sdelicate position with Gazansand its reduced ability to mobilize forces under the threat of Israeli airstrikes. A protest in Beit Lahia on Wednesday. The first protest took place there at around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. “How can it confront this movement? With force? That would cause even greater anger,” noted Akram Atallah, a Palestinian analyst from the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya. Fearful that Israel could try to kill security officers, Hamas may not be able to deploy them, he added. But on Thursday, Hamas operatives wielding batons barred media coverage of the demonstration in Beit Lahia. The protest, which included hundreds of people, still went ahead. Hamas still has a base of supporters in Gaza. Some of them have remained quiet while protests have taken place this week, while others have tried to cast doubt on social media about the motives behind the protests, alleging they were serving foreign agendas, without providing credible proof. The first protest took place in Beit Lahia around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The night before, community members sent around a message calling on residents to take to the streets. “The square is calling on you,” said a screenshot of the message, shared with The New York Times. “Enough of wars. We want to live in peace.”The message came shortly after Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-language spokesman of the Israeli military, posted an order for people to evacuate from Beit Lahia on his social media accounts. Not long after, an airstrike pounded into the town, residents said. Mourning north of Gaza City on Thursday after an Israeli strike. Asked about the strike, the Israeli military said it was operating against Hamas’s military capabilities, without addressing the specific case. Israel has accused Hamas of operating within civilian areas in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. In interviews, protesters said that they hoped Hamas would give up its control over Gaza and remove any reason for Israel to continue to carry out attacks, forcing an end to the war. “We can’t accept that all of us should die for them to stay in power,” said Sharif al-Buheisi, 56, a resident of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza who participated in a protest on Wednesday. Mr. al-Buheisi is an activist in Fatah, Hamas’s rival, and served as an administrator at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City before the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that Israel would not end the war until Hamas’s military wing and government were dismantled, while Hamas has expressed willingness to give up control only of civilian government, not its arms. For Mr. al-Buheisi, an important element of the protests was to push back on the idea — one held by some Israelis — that all of Gaza supported Hamas and terrorism. “We’re affirming that we are a people that love life and our children,” he said. The protests included the participation of some mukhtars, local leaders in towns and villages who hold sway with large parts of their communities, demonstrators said. Before the first march in Beit Lahia, a number of young people approached mukhtars to secure support for the initiative, according to Mr. al-Masri and Hassan Saad, another resident of the town. They offered their blessings, they said. “We’re saying we want to live in dignity,” said Hisham al-Birawi, 64, a mukhtar in Beit Lahia. “We want to live like anyone else.”Nader Ibrahimcontributed reporting.

Tom Moore got the call just before Christmas in 2021. The head of the University of Durham’s archaeology department, Mr. Moore was well-known in history circles in Yorkshire, in northeast England. It was why he had received the urgent message, from a man who claimed to have stumbled on something big. “I think it’s Iron Age,” said the caller, Peter Heads, an amateur metal detectorist. And then, no one said a word. Now, after more than three years of painstaking excavation, conducted in near-total secrecy, Mr. Moore and his colleagues say that it could be one of the most significant archaeological finds in northern England — and could change historians’ understanding of the Iron Age, around 2,000 years ago. “Quite simply, this is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the U.K.,” Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of the government agency Historic England, said in a statement this week. “It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.”Since Mr. Heads’s finding in 2021, a team of archaeologists working at the site has collected a total of more than 800 objects, most dating to the Iron Age. Among them are cauldrons, a wine-mixing bowl, coral-coated horse harnesses and ceremonial spears. They also include 28 iron wheels, presumably from a chariot or wagon — the kinds of transportation mechanisms never before believed to have existed in such size and scope among the elite of Britain’s Iron Age. Experts said that the collection of artifacts — dubbed the Melsonby hoard, for the North Yorkshire town where it was found — stands as an example of how Britain’s complicatedtreasure lawscan work to safeguard potential finds. British law defines anything older than 300 years and consisting of at least 10 percent precious metal as “treasure,” and thus the property of the British crown. After Mr. Heads stumbled on a few pieces of ancient metal, his decision to immediately notify local historians allowed them to quickly protect the site and begin moving the discovery through the legal process. The collection could be one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of recent times, experts said. “It was all done very quietly,” said Professor Moore, who led the excavation. He said that the secrecy was partly to ensure that other, less conscientious detectorists did not try to access the site, and partly so the area could be preserved until the artifacts could be evaluated by British authorities. They eventually assessed the find to be worth around 254,000 pounds (about $329,000). “It was a very responsible metal detectorist who alerted the archaeologists when he found some of the objects,” Mr. Wilson said in an interview. “It was a very good example.”Not everyone shows as much familiarity with the laws as Mr. Heads. Britain’s rules governing metal detecting requiredutiful adherence to reporting requirements, with potential legal consequences for failing to do so. People can use metal detectors on private land with the landowner’s permission, but if they discover something that might be considered treasure, they are required to report it. If the item is determined to be treasure, it becomes the property of the government, which manages its potential acquisition by museums. Proceeds from any sale are split between the detectorists and the landowner. Mr. Heads stumbled on the Melsonby hoard while detecting on the property of a friendly landowner. After digging a few holes and recognizing the potential value of the find, he contacted Mr. Moore, whom he knew from working in the area. “I said to him, ‘Don’t dig it out,’” recalled Mr. Moore. “‘Stop, and I’ll bring a team.’”Officials are working to get the hoard to the Yorkshire Museum, which is running a crowdfunding effort to purchase the collection. “This is a Yorkshire story. This is a history of the place, of the people who organized North Yorkshire,” said Adam Parker, the museum’s curator of archaeology. “We think it’s very important for it to be retained in the north.”For Mr. Parker, Mr. Moore and their colleagues, to finally be able to talk publicly about the Melsonby find is a relief. The discovery was kept quiet for years as the items progressed through the treasures assessment process, keeping them from discussing the matter with other experts. “We’re really excited now,” Mr. Moore said. “We can kind of start the research process.”Archaeological DiscoveriesSkeletons of the Roman Empire: Under a soccer field in Vienna, archaeologists have found a mass grave dating to the era when the Roman Empire was battling Germanic tribes almost 2,000 years ago, experts announced.

Reporting from LondonTurkey Deports BBC Reporter Who Covered Mass ProtestsRights groups said the detention and deportation of the reporter, Mark Lowen, was part of an escalation in government pressure against independent journalism. The BBC said on Thursday that Turkey had deported a correspondent who was coveringthe antigovernment protestsin the country, after he was detained and labeled “a threat to public order.”The broadcaster said in astatementthat Mark Lowen, one of its correspondents, was detained in Istanbul where he was covering theprotests and political crisisignited by thearrest last week of Ekrem Imamoglu, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s top rival. Mr. Lowen was taken from his hotel on Wednesday and held for 17 hours, the BBC said. “To be detained and deported from the country where I previously lived for five years and for which I have such affection has been extremely distressing,” Mr. Lowen said in a statement, after arriving in London on Thursday. “Press freedom and impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy.”The broadcaster would reach out to the Turkish authorities, said Deborah Turness, the chief executive of BBC News. “No journalist should face this kind of treatment simply for doing their job,” she said, and called Mr. Lowen’s treatment “extremely troubling.”An official from the Turkish government’s Directorate of Communications said Mr. Lowen had been deported because he didn’t have a press card or accreditation to work in Turkey. Hundreds of thousands of Turks have protested in cities across the country since the arrest of Mr. Imamoglu on accusations of corruption and supporting terrorism. About 170 people have been jailed pending trial, the country’s interior ministry said as of Wednesday. Mr. Imamoglu, who wasremoved from his post as mayorand jailed pending trial on the corruption charges, has said his arrest was politically motivated. Critics of Mr. Erdogan said the moves were the latest example of his increasinglyauthoritarian tacticsafter two decades in power. Mr. Lowen, a well-known correspondent who had previously lived in Turkey for five years, was not the only journalist to be caught up in the crackdown. Of the more than 1,300 people that the interior ministry has said have been arrested in connection with the protests, 11 were journalists. Seven of the detained reporters, including a photographer for the French news agency Agence France-Presse, were released without charge on Thursday. Human rights activists and media experts said the treatment of Mr. Lowen and other reporters was a sharp escalation of government efforts to suppress or intimidate independent journalism. “Credible, mainstream, international media sources have not been targeted so much in recent years,” Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director at Human Rights Watch, said. “This represents quite a departure,” she said, adding that the crackdown was part of a “full-scale assault on democracy.”Emre Kizilkaya, a Turkish journalist and a fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the media had long been targeted by the government but the atmosphere during the protests was “unprecedented.”“Mark Lowen’s case cannot be considered as an isolated incident,” he said. Before the protests, journalists in Turkey faced “systematic online censorship” and “arbitrary lawsuits,” according to the rights group Reporters Without Borders, which ranked Turkey158th out of the 180 countriesin its 2024 World Press Freedom Index. The group condemned the treatment of Mr. Lowen in a statement on Thursday, andsaid earlier in the weekthat detentions of journalists during the protests represented an increase in government pressure on the press. “This is the first time that clearly identified journalists who were in the middle of working have been sent to prison under this law against public gatherings and protests,” Erol Onderoglu, the Turkey representative for Reporters Without Borders, said.

Rescue workers pulled 39 people from the Red Sea after the accident, the provincial governor said. Rania Khaled reported from Cairo and Lynsey Chutel from London. Tourist Submarine Sinks Off Egypt, With 6 People DeadThe vessel was carrying 45 people on a coral reef tour near Hurghada, a Red Sea resort. A submarine carrying Russian tourists sank off Egypt’s Red Sea coast on Thursday, leaving at least six people dead and rescue workers scrambling to pull people out of the water, local officials said. The vessel was carrying 45 people on a tour of the coral reef off the coast near Hurghada, a popular resort city nearly 300 miles southeast of Cairo. Rescue workers had pulled 39 people from the waters, all foreign tourists, Amr Hanafi, the governor of Egypt’s Red Sea Province, said. All the passengers were accounted for, he added. The Russian Embassy in Egypt said in a statement on social media that four Russian tourists had died. The vessel was less than a mile from the shore when it sank at around 10 a.m. local time, the embassy said. The submarine was owned by the Sindbad resort in Hurghada, according to the embassy. Recreational submarines are popular among tour operators along the strip of vacation towns and resorts for exploring the area’s colorfulcoral reefs. The Sindbad resort owns two submarines that are able to dive about 25 meters, or 82 feet, underwater, according toan archive of its website captured in January. The section of the site describing the vessels appeared to be online early Thursday but wasmissing later in the day. The vessels could seat 44 tourists, according to the site, along with two crew members. Staff members who responded to calls to the resort’s front desk said the vessel that sank had belonged to Sindbad, but declined to provide their names. The hotel did not respond to requests for comment. The Russian Embassy said the tour had been organized by Biblio Globus Egypt Tours. The company, which is based in Hurghada, according to records from theEgyptian Travel Agents Association, could not be reached and its website was down. The vessel had a valid license and its captain had the proper training, the governor, Mr. Hanafi, said. Egypt has a history of problems involving tourist boats. Britain’s Maritime Accident Investigation Branch issued a warning last month about safety issues on Red Sea dive boats where passengers stay aboard. The agency’s reportcited 16 accidentsinvolving such vessels over the past five years, resulting in several deaths. It said the vessels were often poorly constructed, with substandard emergency routes, or run by operators who were not properly trained to respond in emergency situations. In November last year, four people died when a boat carrying 44 passengerssank during a six-day diving tripfrom Marsa Alam, another Red Sea resort. The trip was supposed to end in Hurghada."
Rescuers Race to Save People and Treasures From South Korea Wildfires,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/asia/south-korea-wildfires-heritage.html,2025-03-27T11:34:15Z,World,"The country’s largest blaze on record has left 27 dead and destroyed heritage sites, including two 1,000-year-old temples.",Wildfires; Historic Buildings and Sites; Fires and Firefighters; Evacuations and Evacuees; Deaths (Fatalities),,South Korea,," Chang W. Lee, a staff photographer, reported from the region struck by wildfires. Rescuers Race to Save People and Treasures From South Korea WildfiresThe country’s largest blaze on record has left 27 dead and destroyed heritage sites, including two 1,000-year-old temples. South Korea’s largest wildfires on record blazed through the country’s southeast for a seventh day, with firefighters, soldiers and heritage workers racing to evacuate people and save ancient treasures from the encroaching flames. At least 37,000 people were evacuated from their homes as the fires, which have left 27 people dead, spread in the dry and windy weather. The fires had burned over 88,000 acres of land, the biggest on record in South Korea, according to the Interior Ministry. The largest blaze in Euiseong County was only about halfway contained on Thursday. The Namhu Agricultural Complex was burned by fires, in Andong City, South Korea. Rescue crews were also focusing on saving as many relics and heritage buildings as possible after two 1,000-year-old Buddhist temples burned to the ground. Around two dozen buildings, trees, statues and other things with national heritage status have been lost to the flames so far, according to the Korea Heritage Service, the government body responsible for the conservation of national treasures and sites. A statue of a seated Buddha from the early 9th century was reduced to ashes. And the base and branches of a 400-year-old tree considered the guardian of a local village were charred in the flames. The heritage service said it deployed around 750 people across the region to protect or remove what still remains. The southeastern region is home to a large proportion of the more than 4,000 items on the country’s national heritage list. At Gounsa Temple in Euiseong County, the main temple building survived the wildfire while surrounding buildings were destroyed as the wildfire swept through on Wednesday. In the city of Andong, firefighters and officials worked to protect UNESCO Heritage sites as the inferno threatened to spread to those locations. In the 600-year-old Hahoe folk village, firefighters hosed buildings as helicopters dropped buckets of water from above. Workers relocated signage from the Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy, a tourist attraction. While the government has successfully evacuated tens of thousands of residents across at least eight cities and counties, thousands of others have stayed behind. Many remained to protect their homes, businesses, livestock and pets. Local residents pleaded with firefighters to put out fires near their houses or restaurants. One Andong resident said he and his wife were at home when their house caught fire. They had tried, but failed, to stop the fire by dousing it with water and were forced to evacuate. But they wanted to stay close to their house to protect their 22 cows, which survived, so they have been sleeping inside their car since Tuesday. Earlier this week, strong winds kept helicopters and drones grounded, officials said. One pilot died when a helicopter crashed while fighting the fire, though officials have not disclosed the cause. Smoke and smog decreased road and air visibility, making driving and flying nearly impossible. The Interior Ministry said a lawn mower had started the first of the fires on Friday. Evacuees from villages affected by the wildfires resting at Andong Yongsang Elementary School on Thursday. Conditions had improved by Thursday, and over 100 helicopters were deployed to the missions, according to the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters. At least one U.S. military helicopter joined the effort, the government said. Emergency workers and residents are hoping the weather may turn in their favor, with light rain forecast for Thursday by the country’s meteorological agency. Government officials said this would do little to help put out the fires but could weaken the further spread of the flames."
"In Controversial Shake-Up, Israeli Lawmakers Give Themselves More Power to Choose Judges",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-judges.html,2025-03-27T10:39:02Z,World,"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, appears to have returned to the  judicial overhaul that divided the country before the war in Gaza.",Courts and the Judiciary; Attorneys General,"Netanyahu, Benjamin",Israel,Shin Bet,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the Knesset in Jerusalem on Thursday. Reporting from JerusalemIn Controversial Shake-Up, Israeli Lawmakers Give Themselves More Power to Choose JudgesBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, appears to have returned to the  judicial overhaul that divided the country before the war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition enacted legislation on Thursday that handed politicians more control over picking judges, part of a contentiouseffort to overhaul the Israeli judiciarythat roiled the country before the war with Hamas. Israel’s 120-seat Parliament passed two laws after an hourslong overnight debate, in a vote mostly boycotted by the opposition. The legislation revamps the committee that picks judges, including Supreme Court justices, in a way that critics say will politicize the bench. The law marked the resumption of a two-year effort by Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition to expand its control over other branches of government. Before the Hamas-led attack in October 2023 started the war in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu had attempted similar legislation in the face of mass protests. He suspended the push to preserve wartime unity. Now, Mr. Netanyahu has returned to the judicial overhaul, along with simultaneous efforts to weaken other state watchdogs. He is trying to fire boththe attorney generaland thehead of the domestic intelligence service. The laws that passed on Thursday were less far-reaching than the coalition’s initial proposals. But they nonetheless threatened to reignite theuproar that swept the countrybefore the war, even as Israel and Hamas are engaging innew fighting in Gaza. Crowds of protesters rallied outside the Parliament in Jerusalem on Wednesday to demonstrate against the legislation, waving Israeli flags. But in a sign of how the war has split the priorities of Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents, many also showed up carrying signs calling for  an immediate deal with Hamas to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. Protesters in Jerusalem on Wednesday night. Inside the Parliament building, Mr. Netanyahu gave a fiery address in which he contended that his government’s policies would serve as a long-needed corrective to an unelected “deep state,” echoingrhetoric used by President Trump“Democracy is not in danger. The rule of bureaucrats is in danger,” Mr. Netanyahu told lawmakers. “The deep state is in danger.”Unlike in the United States, in Israel a single nine-member committee is empowered by law to appoint judges, including Supreme Court justices. In a policy designed to ensure judicial independence, five of them were either current Supreme Court justices or expert lawyers from the Israeli bar association. The remaining four were politicians representing both the coalition and the opposition. But Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition has long wanted to give itself more power on the committee, which would allow it to shape the next generation of judges. Yariv Levin, the justice minister who planned the overhaul, originally proposed a law that would effectively allow the coalition to dominate the committee. Opponents said that granting the ruling coalition greater influence in picking judges who review its legislation would remove one of Israel’s few checks on executive power. Israel is a highly centralized state without a formal constitution. Mr. Levin has framed the legislation that passed on Thursday as a compromise that did not go as far as the government’s critics had initially feared. Under the new system, political appointees — one from the coalition and one from the opposition — would replace the two experts from the Israeli bar. And unlike before, when a supermajority of seven was required to pick a new Supreme Court justice, the legislation enacted on Thursday only a requires a simple majority — giving more leeway to politicians and their appointees. Yedidia Stern, a law professor who has sought to mediate a middle ground on the overhaul, said the changes would still politicize the process of picking judges and would encourage the selection of more extreme justices to the Supreme Court. Politicians and their representatives will now control six seats on the nine-member committee, meaning that the selection of justices would likely become a matter of political horse-trading, he said. He argued that by engaging in so many divisive actions at once, Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition was seeking to overwhelm an already war-weary and distracted Israeli public, in an attempt to dispel an effective response. “They have managed to exploit the war — and the energy it has drained from the public — to create tectonic changes in Israeli democracy,” he said. “I don’t think we can say that Israel is no longer democratic. But if this goes through, it will be a far weaker democracy.”Thursday’s legislation is one in a series of moves by the Israeli government that critics view as attempts by Mr. Netanyahu and his allies to cement their power. Last week, Mr. Netanyahu dismissed Ronen Bar, the head of the country’s Shin Bet security service,saying he no longer trusted him. Under Mr. Bar’s direction, the Shin Bet has been involved in probing potential Qatari interference in Israeli decision-making, including inside Mr. Netanyahu’s own office. Just a few days later, the Israeli government effectively began the process of dismissing Gali Baharav-Miara, Israel’s attorney general. Ms. Baharav-Miara had frequently clashed with Mr. Netanyahu on policy. She also oversees the country’s prosecutors, including those who are currentlytrying Mr. Netanyahu for corruption. Mr. Netanyahu’s critics have noted that a new attorney general could suspend or even cancel his trial. The prime minister denies wrongdoing.

South Sudan’s Vice President Has Been Placed Under House Arrest, Party SaysThe United Nations warned that the detention of Vice President Riek Machar threatens to push the world’s youngest country back into civil war. South Sudan’s vice president, Riek Machar, has been placed under house arrest, according to his party, escalating tensions that the United Nations has warned are pushing the world’s youngest country to the brink of civil war. The country’s defense minister and the chief of national security “forcefully entered” Mr. Machar’s residence late on Wednesday, disarmed his bodyguards and “delivered an arrest warrant to him under unclear charges,” according to Mr. Machar’s political party, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition. Mr. Machar’s wife, Angelina Teny, who is the interior minister, was placed under house arrest, too, the party’s deputy leader said in a statement. All of Mr. Machar’s aides and protection officers “were arrested and moved to separate locations,” he added. The arrests threaten the fragile peace agreementsigned in 2018between Mr. Machar and President Salva Kiir, which ended a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. A return to war in South Sudan could draw neighboring nations into the conflict and exacerbate the already-dire conditions for the country’s more than 11 million people. The peace deal established a power-sharing agreement between the country’s largest ethnic groups, Mr. Kiir’s Dinka and Mr. Machar’s Nuer, which fought a bloody civil war that erupted roughly two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. But all that has appeared to becoming undonein recent weeks, as deep-seated political and ethnic tensions have flared up and forces allied with both sides have clashed in the northeastern Upper Nile State. The violence hasdisplacedat least 50,000 people since February, the U.N. said, with 10,000 of those crossing the border into Ethiopia seeking safety. On Wednesday, the U.N. said that South Sudan’s military and opposition forces had been clashing just south and west of the capital in recent days. Mr. Machar’s detention effectively killed the peace deal, his party’s deputy leader, Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, said in a statement. Another senior party official, Reath Muoch Tang, called it a “blatant violation of the Constitution.” In astatementposted on social media, he added that arresting Mr. Machar “without due process undermines the rule of law and threatens the stability of the nation.”The U.S. State Department said it was concerned about reports that Mr. Machar was “under house arrest” and,in a post on social media,called on Mr. Kiir “to reverse this action & prevent further escalation of the situation.”Both theUnited StatesandBritainsaid they would reduce staffing at their embassies in South Sudan because of the increasing insecurity in the country. The U.N. mission in South Sudansaidin a statement that Mr. Machar’s detention risked “returning the country into a state of war,” adding, “This will not only devastate South Sudan, but also affect the entire region.”Last month, Mr. Machar’s political party accused the authorities of persecuting its supporters and arresting some of the vice president’s close associates, including the deputy army chief, Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, and the petroleum minister, Puot Kang Chol. At least 22 political and military leaders connected to Mr. Machar have been detained in recent weeks, with thewhereabouts of some of them still unknown, Human Rights Watch said. In the Upper Nile State in the northeast of the country, South Sudan’s national army has also clashed with an armed force believed to be allied with Mr. Machar. This month, a U.N. helicopter evacuating wounded soldiers from the statewas attacked, leading to the death of one crew member and several military officers, including a general. Mr. Machar’s detention came days after he wrote a strongly worded letter to the U.N. and African Union expressing concern over the deployment of Ugandan troops in the country. Their presence, he said, violated the peace deal. Uganda’s defense minister, Jacob Oboth, told Parliament last week that Mr. Kiir had asked for the Ugandan troops to be deployed. President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has been a longtime ally of Mr. Kiir. Uganda is worried that a large-scale conflict in the neighboring country could result in a surge of refugees crossing the border and wider regional instability.

Archaeologists Find Huge Tomb of Unknown Pharaoh in EgyptThe burial chamber most likely belonged to a ruler in a line of kings once lost to history, researchers said. “It’s a new chapter in investigating this dynasty,” one noted. Archaeologists have unearthed the huge tomb of an unknown pharaoh at an Egyptian necropolis, a team of researchers said on Thursday, in the second discovery of a king’s tomb this year. The team of Egyptian and American archaeologists found the tomb, which the researchers estimate is 3,600 years old, nearly 23 feet underground at Abydos, one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt. The city, about 300 miles south of Cairo, was a burial place for early pharaohs, and a necropolis developed at Anubis Mountain to the city’s south. Researchers uncovered the tomb at the mountain, at the base of a high desert cliff where strong winds carry gusts of sand. In some places around the necropolis, sand has buried structures more than 16 or 19 feet deep. The burial chamber features a decorated entryway, several rooms and soaring 16-foot vaults made of mud bricks. It dwarfs a tomb unearthed at Abydos over a decade ago, which washailed at the timeas the first material proof of a “lost” dynasty of kings there. “It’s a new chapter in investigating this dynasty,” Josef Wegner, a curator at the Penn Museum in Philadelphia and the leader of the American side of the excavation, said in an interview on Wednesday. “It’s pretty exciting.”The king once buried in this tomb was thought to have ruled parts of Egypt some 3,600 years ago. Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities brieflydescribed the findingsat Abydos earlier this month, but researchers at the Penn Museum announced more about the discovery on Thursday. Similarities between the newly unearthed tomb and the one discovered in 2014, which belonged to a king named Seneb-Kay, have led the archaeologists to conclude that the as-yet-unknown pharaoh may have been an earlier member of the so-called Abydos dynasty. In the newly discovered tomb, painted scenes on plastered brickwork decorate the entrance to the limestone burial chamber, showing the goddess Isis and her sister Nephthys, who were often paired in funerary rites. “This tomb and Seneb-Kay’s tomb are the earliest surviving royal tombs that actually have painted decorations inside,” Mr. Wegner said. But there were no identifiable skeletal remains at the newly unearthed site and, like a tomb foundnear the Valley of the Kingsthis year, the one at Abydos has suffered major damage over the centuries. At Abydos, grave robbers picked the tomb largely clean. A grand recess in the burial chamber for canopic jars — vessels for organs, typically held in a gilded box — stood empty. Archaeologists have found pottery and inscriptions around Abydos showing that, during the late Roman period around 1,700 years ago, people were digging into tombs to extract the limestone, granite and quartzite within. And although the name of the ruler in the newly excavated tomb had once been visible in yellow bands of hieroglyphic texts, the actions of ancient grave robbers had rendered it illegible. “They did just enough damage to the decoration that we have just the very base of what would have been the identifying text columns,” Mr. Wegner said. The frustrated team of researchers expressed “some cuss words,” Mr. Wegner added. “But the archaeological record doesn’t always yield exactly what you hope for, so you keep going.”“This is a really significant find,” said Kathryn Howley, an archaeologist at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.  It helped illuminate an era when ancient Egypt was fragmented between competing powers who left less material for researchers to study today, she added. “In other words, we don’t have a huge amount of source material to work with, and that’s why a new discovery like this is so exciting,” she said. “It really has the potential to rewrite the history of ancient Egypt.”Mr. Wegner, noting that Seneb-Kay’s skeleton suggested that he may have died in combat, said the period appeared to be “a phase of warrior pharaohs fighting it out.”But the new findings suggested, he added, that the Abydos dynasty was not “a kind of flash in the pan where you’ve got a handful of kings breaking off from whatever original territory they belonged to.”While the extent of the land controlled by those buried here is not known, “the Abydos dynasty kings only appeared to rule a region around the city, rather than all of Egypt,” said Matthew Adams, an archaeologist who works on an unrelated project in the area. “But their use of the title of ‘king’ suggests they had aspirations to something greater.”And although these kings were not recorded in ancient Egyptian king lists, the monumental qualities of the new tomb “are unusual and enormous, especially for a ruler for whom we know no other monumental architecture,” Ms. Howley said. “The discovery raises questions we didn’t even know to ask before.”Mr. Wegner said there were several candidates for who had been interred in this tomb, including kings named Senaiib and Paentjeni who dedicated monuments at Abydos. He added that the team would work to manage and protect the area, and that it had plans to keep excavating in search of other tombs. “It’s always our dream to find one that’s intact or partially intact,” he said. “There may yet be tombs like that.”Skeletons of the Roman Empire: Under a soccer field in Vienna, archaeologists have found a mass grave dating to the era when the Roman Empire was battling Germanic tribes almost 2,000 years ago, experts announced. Ancient Hunting Kit Found: The 6,500-year-old weapons, found in a cave in West Texas, could be among theoldest near-complete set of wood and stone hunting toolsfound in North America. Jewish Ritual Bath: Archaeologists uncovered what may be theoldest existing example in the ancient Roman world of a mikvah. They have tentatively dated the structure to the late fourth or early fifth century. Perfecting Avocados: According to a recently published paper, people in what we today call Honduras made avocados a part of their diets at least 10,000 years ago andpurposefully improved them starting more than 7,500 years ago.

News AnalysisU.S. officials seek to curb the militants’ attacks on ships in the Red Sea, but the group was not deterred by strikes in the Biden era and won’t be beaten by air power alone, experts say. The bombshell publication of a group chat involving Trump administration officials discussingU.S. battle plansrevealedin unusually stark fashion what the Trump administration hopes to achieve withairstrikesthis monthagainst the Houthi militia in Yemen. The attacks, some of the chat’s participants said, were meant to deter the Houthis from attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea and reopen shipping lanes to the Suez Canal. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes,” said a participant identified as Michael Waltz, President Trump’s national security adviser. But the high-level hopes expressed in the Signal chat, which became public after The Atlantic’s editor in chief was inadvertently added to it, could collide with reality. Middle East experts said the Iran-backed Houthis won’t be easily beaten. Few wars have been won with air power alone, and some military experts say it will be no different with the Houthis. The biggest shipping companies also have little appetite for returning to the Red Sea. They have found a workaround that, while inconvenient and costly, allows them to avoid those lanes and deliver goods on time. James R. Holmes, the J.C. Wylie Chair of Maritime Strategy at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, said that even during the U.S. war to remove Iraq from Kuwait in 1991, when air power was at its apex, a land invasion was necessary — and defeating the Houthis might require an occupation. “You have to control turf to win,” Mr. Holmes said. “Aircraft cannot occupy territory, however valuable a supporting capability they are for armies and Marines.”The Houthis may even use the U.S. military strikes, analysts say, to bolster their position in Yemen and farther afield as other Iranian proxies, like the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, have suffered heavy losses at the hands of Israel. An image taken from a video following bombardment in Sana on March 19. The latest U.S. strikes are a “direct answer to the Houthi prayers to have a war with the U.S.,” said Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at Chatham House, a research institute based in London. He said the group “wants to drag the U.S. into a larger regional escalation.”The Trump administration has called the Houthis a threat to the safety of Americans, U.S. allies and the stability of global maritime trade. In addition to the military strikes, the administration officiallyre-designated the Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organization.”Mr. Trump vowed this month that the group would be “completely annihilated” and warned Iran to “immediately” stop supplying it with military equipment and providing it general support. The Trump administration says its strikes will be more effective than those carried out by the Biden administration. Another chat participant, identified as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said, “Biden cratered” U.S. deterrence. With heavier bombing, targeted strikes against Houthi leaders and successful efforts to cut off financial flows to the militia, the United States may succeed. But history is not on its side. From 2015 to 2022, the Houthis fought off a Saudi-led coalition, which launched a war to restore Yemen’s internationally recognized government and counter Iran’s influence in the region. And even if the United States successfully pressures Iran into limiting its support to the Houthis, the militants have shown they can act independently, analysts said. “The group withstood seven years of Saudi-led airstrikes and a year of U.S. strikes under the Biden administration, which yielded little effect,” said Luca Nevola, a senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a crisis monitoring group. James Hewitt, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement on Wednesday, “While this is still an ongoing operation, we have had major positive indications from our efforts, including taking out key Houthi leadership, and carried out strikes on more than 100 Houthi targets, including air-defense systems, headquarters, command and control, and weapons manufacturing and storage facilities.”The Houthis have been striking ships in the Red Sea since late 2023, targeting vessels that the group believes arelinked to Israel, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. A period of relative calm followed after a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was struck in January. But then the Houthis issued a warning on March 12, saying they would restart attacks on Israeli vessels in retaliation for Israel’s closure of Gaza’s crossings and the blockade of humanitarian aid. A photograph released by the Suez Canal Authority showed a Greek-registered ship that was attacked by Houthi militants last year in the Red Sea. It was towed through the Suez Canal in Egypt this month. Since the U.S. strikes began this month, the Houthis have launched at least eight ballistic missiles at Israel in the past two weeks, most recently on Thursday, though most were intercepted. Israeli warplanes have retaliatedby bombing ports and a power plant in Yemeni territory controlled by the Houthis. Historically, great powers have aimed to protect shipping because an interruption in global trade flows can trigger shortages and high inflation, causing economic havoc. Much of the group chat among Trump administration officials focused on opening shipping lanes. “Restoring freedom of navigation” was “a core national interest,” Mr. Hegseth said. But although the U.S. military has been conducting daily strikes against Houthi targets, the Pentagonhas not provided details about the attacks since March 17, when it said more than 30 Houthi targets had been hit on the first day. Yemeni officials say the strikes also hit residential areas and buildings in Sana, the capital, causing an unknown number of civilian casualties. And the Houthis have largely succeeded in frightening off Western vessels from the Red Sea. Since they started targeting ships in 2023, they have carried out about 130 attacks on commercial vessels, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, the crisis monitoring group. Yemen officials said the airstrikes have caused civilian casualties. That has prompted freighters going from Asia to Europe to stop traveling through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal and insteadgo around the southern tip of Africa— a voyage that is about 3,500 nautical miles and 10 days longer. The cost of shipping surged as companies scrambled to reorganize their routes and add more vessels. But within months, they adapted to the longer voyages, and this year shipping rates plunged. Shipping executives say they won’t return to the Red Sea until there is a Middle East peace accord that includes the Houthis or a defeat of the militia. “It’s either a full degradation of their capabilities or there is some type of deal,” Vincent Clerc, chief executive of Maersk, a shipping line based in Denmark, said in February. On Wednesday, a Maersk spokesman said in a statement, “Our priority remains to be the safety of our seafarers, vessels and customer’s cargo.”In the group chat, there was dispute about whether reopening the Red Sea shipping lanes was of crucial national interest. A participant identified as Vice President JD Vance contended that the lanes were far more important to Europe than the United States. The United States does not rely on the Suez Canal because its seaborne trade with Asia goes across the Pacific, and with Europe, it travels across the Atlantic. But shipping analysts said the Suez Canal is still a crucial waterway for the United States. The attacks have hit residential areas and buildings in Sana, officials in Yemen say. Its importance became clear in recent years, when other shipping routes —the Panama Canalcoveted by Mr. Trump, for instance — were severely restricted or closed, said Rico Luman, senior economist for transport, logistics and automotive at ING Research. “Maritime shipping is a global market and everything is interconnected,” he said. Some in the chat criticized Europe for not doing enough militarily to reopen the Red Sea for shipping. “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Mr. Vance said. But the European Union had deployeda small naval forcein the Red Sea since early last year to defend against attacks, and the mission was extended to next February. Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a research institute that favors restraint in foreign policy, said Europe had, indeed, gotten a free ride on American military power. But she added that the Europeans had decided they could absorb the extra shipping costs and that a big military effort against the Houthis was probably not worth it. “The United States shouldn’t be taking military action in the Red Sea — even if Europe continues to refrain from doing so,” she said.

Drones, Mines and Snipers: Ukraine’s Front Line Is a World Away from Peace TalksFor soldiers and commanders on the edge of battle, any talk about a lasting cease-fire still feels like a dangerous fantasy. Hunted by drones, stalked by snipers and surrounded by minefields, soldiers fighting in Ukraine can’t risk even a small lapse in concentration. That is why Col. Dmytro Palisa, commander of Ukraine’s 33rd Mechanized Brigade, instructs his soldiers to ignore speculation about a possible cease-fire. “They start relaxing, they start overthinking, putting on rose-colored glasses, thinking that tomorrow will be easier. No,” he said in an interview at a command post on the eastern front. “We shoot until we are given the order to stop.”As diplomats and European leaders thousands of miles away talk about a possible truce andhow to safeguard it, Russia and Ukraine are engaged in bloody battles as intense as any of the war. The furious fighting, tearing across the Ukrainian front, is, in part, a late play for land and leverage in the talks, which the Trump administration says are making progress. But it is also evidence of deep skepticism about the negotiations: Even if incremental steps such asa pause in violence on the Black Seamanage to take hold —few Ukrainian soldiers or civilians believeit would lead to a lasting peace. Both sides are still battling to establish better positions for future fighting. Firing toward Russian targets on Saturday. As diplomats thousands of miles away talk about a possible truce, Russia and Ukraine are engaged in bloody battles as intense as any of the war. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says he believes Russia intends to launch new offensive operations “to put maximum pressure on Ukraine and then issue ultimatums from a position of strength,” as he put it last week. Kyiv wants to deny Moscow that advantage. Ukrainian forces remain outnumbered and outgunned —much as they have beensince Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago. But they have largely halted Russian advances so far this year and are now engaged in localized counterattacks to claw back land. Military analysts tracking battlefield developmentsconfirm that the already glacial paceof Russian advances has largely stalled, even though Moscow’s forces continue to launch assaults along key parts of the front. ‘This war keeps changing the rules’In interviews from the front line, Ukrainian soldiers and military leaders credited several factors for their resilience: New defensive strategies that more completely integrate drones, rapid adaptation to shifting threats, signs of Russian fatigue and improving morale under a new commander of ground forces, Gen. Mykhailo Drapatyi. “This war keeps changing the rules,” Colonel Palisa said. “That means we constantly have to adapt. Every night, before going to sleep, we already have to plan an alternative strategy for tomorrow.”TheUkrainian retreatfrom most of the Kursk region of Russia earlier this month promises to again reshape the contours of the fight. Tens of thousands of soldiers dedicated to Moscow’s seven-month campaign to retake Russian land there can now be redeployed. Col. Oleh Hrudzevych, 35, deputy commander of Ukraine’s 43rd Mechanized Brigade, said that the Kursk campaign “really pulled a significant part of enemy forces” and firepower from other parts of the front. For instance, he said, while battles raged in Kursk, there was a 50 percent drop in the number of aerial bombs — one of Russia’smost effective weapons— inthe Kupiansk areaon the northern edge of the eastern front, where he is deployed. A drone team preparing to deploy to their position for the night. Ukrainian forces remain outnumbered and outgunned, but they have largely halted Russian advances so far this year. Russian forces, he said, have been limited to “mosquito bite” tactics — small assaults that generally end in failure. But he expects that Russia may now redirect some forces to his area. Capt. Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the 429th Achilles Unmanned Systems Regiment, said that the main task along the northeastern part of the front was keeping Russian troops from expanding their small foothold onthe Oskil River. Unable to erect pontoon bridges because of the threat posed by Ukrainian drones and artillery, the Russian forces have been using small boats to ferry men and equipment across the river under the cover of bad weather. Captain Fedorenko said that for nearly a month, Russian units had failed to expand their position and continued to pay a heavy price to hold the land they have. “We conducted a drone flyover of a small tree line about 200 meters long and quite narrow,” he said. “In that one tree line alone, we counted around 190 enemy bodies.”Drone footage shared by the Ukrainian military with The Times generally supports his account. But it was not possible to independently verify the precise number of Russian soldiers who were killed or injured, or to measure the Ukrainian losses over that same period of time. Medics treating an injured Ukrainian soldier at a stabilization point. The Ukrainian retreat from most of the Kursk region of Russia earlier this month promises to again reshape the contours of the fight. Hundreds of miles away, on the banks of the Dnipro River on the southern front, the Russian forces are searching for weak points in the Ukrainian line. Two months ago, Russian troops launched a series of cross-river assaults — using some 15 to 20 boats in each attack, soldiers said — but the effort failed. Now, the Russian military is launching probing attacks, trying to press north along the river towardthe city of Zaporizhzhia, which is under Ukrainian control. President Vladimir V. Putin and other Russian officials have said publicly that their goal is to fully control the city and the surrounding area. But their plans to try to encircle Zaporizhzhia were put on hold when Russian troops were redirected to Kursk, said Sr. Sgt. Andrii Klymenko, who has been fighting in the area for many months. His claim wassupported by analystswho track Russian military movements. “Now they’re simply going to revive it,” he said. A ‘Mad Max’ aestheticMuch of the most ferocious fighting continues to be concentrated in the rolling hills and ruined industrial cities of the eastern Donbas region, where after three yearsRussia has failedto seize control of two coveted targets: the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. Colonel Palisa oversees a stretch of Ukrainian defenses south of Pokrovsk, a city in Donetsk, where Russian offensive operationsmade the bulk of their progresslast year. But Colonel Palisa said that aggressive drone warfare and smart defensive tactics had, for now, blunted Russia’s advantages. “The enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in this sector for the past three to four weeks,” he noted. “As of now, we can say that we have stabilized the situation.”At the same time, he added, his forces have had to adjust to a growing threat: the proliferation of Russian drones tethered to ultrathin fiber-optic cables that render them immune to electronic jamming. “When they didn’t have fiber optics, we could still move around,” he said. After the fiber-optic drones appeared, he said, his brigade lost some 10 vehicles in just seven days. A mechanic welding a metal cage used to protect large vehicles during drone attacks. Much of the most ferocious fighting continues to be concentrated in the rolling hills and ruined industrial cities of the eastern Donbas region. “That made me realize that we had to completely change our approach and abandon vehicles altogether,” he said. Like their Russian counterparts, Ukrainian soldiers now frequently use quad bikes and buggies or move on foot. They often wear cloaks that mask a soldier’s heat signature from drones outfitted with thermal vision cameras. Netting has been strung over critical supply roads, a simple but effective defense that Colonel Palisa said had cut successful enemy attacks by more than half. And soldiers now routinely carry shotguns along with their assault rifles. It makes for a sort of ‘Mad Max’ aesthetic as tanks and armored vehicles mix with civilian cars, motorcycles and quad bikes retrofitted with cages and jammers. The low-tech adaptations, along with a broad restructuring of the military, are strategies that Kyiv hopes will allow Ukraine to continue fighting — even as its primary military ally, the United States,pulls back support, increasinglyrepeats the Kremlin’s narrativeand pressures Ukraine into cease-fire negotiations. A soldier searching the skies for Russian drones. On the front line, any talk about a lasting peace still feels like a dangerous fantasy. Soldiers say they believe that the fighting will continue until the price of war becomes too high for the Kremlin to bear and Ukraine is made strong enough to deter any future aggression. “We are fighting for the right to live,” Captain Fedorenko said. “Americans must understand that this is not about pressuring Ukraine into some abstract peace.

"Rattled by Trump, America’s Allies Shift to Defense Mode",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/asia/tariffs-us-allies-trump.html,2025-03-27T08:01:45Z,World,The new auto tariffs are straining relations with U.S. allies and deepening doubts about America’s reliability as a partner.,International Trade and World Market; United States International Relations; Customs (Tariff); International Relations; Factories and Manufacturing; Automobiles,"Trump, Donald J",Canada; East Asia,European Union,"Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, center, at a factory in Halifax, on Tuesday. Mr. Carney on Wednesday described President Trump’s latest tariffs as “a direct attack.” Damien Cave often covers global affairs. He is based in Vietnam. Steven Erlanger has been covering European diplomacy and trade for decades, and is based in Berlin. Rattled by Trump, America’s Allies Shift to Defense ModeNews AnalysisThe new auto tariffs are straining relations with U.S. allies and deepening doubts about America’s reliability as a partner. President Trump’s unexpected plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on cars and car parts imported into the United States will not only disrupt supply chains. It will also fuel anger and alienation — and pressure to retaliate — among American allies across the globe. Many of the countries most affected by the new levies, such as South Korea, Japan, Germany, Mexico and Canada, are already reeling from the Trump team’s disregard for free trade deals already signed and his threats to long-established security relationships. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada said on Wednesday that Trump’s move on tariffs was “a direct attack.” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the result would be “bad for businesses” and “worse for consumers.” Robert Habeck, Germany’s acting economics minister, said, “It is now important for the E.U. to respond decisively to the tariffs — it must be clear that we will not back down in the face of the U.S.”Other leaders reacted in muted terms, hinting that they were still considering how to respond, with another round of tariffs, in addition to this one, expected in early April. “We need to consider what’s best for Japan’s national interest,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan told Parliament on Thursday. “We’re putting all options on the table in considering the most effective response.”The tariffs, which threaten both American and foreign carmakers, increase the likelihood of a global trade war. A chain reaction of economic nationalism with tariffs and other measures — perhaps adding costs for finance and services — could suppress economic growth globally, spread inflation and add rancor to already testy negotiations with Washington about security. The Trump White House has sought to use every tool of American power, including its military support and consumer market, to extract what Mr. Trump sees as a better deal for Americans. But for countries that have spent decades trusting America and tying their economies and defense plans to Washington’s promises, this feels like a moment of reversal. American influence, long built on pronouncements about values and the shared riches of free trade, has hardened into what many analysts describe as “all stick, no carrot.” In the Trump team’s thinking, critics argue, American gains require pain for others — friends included. “Everything is a status competition or a dominance competition,” said Andrew Kydd, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin who incorporates psychology into studies of international relations. “I think this is characteristic of extremists of all stripes — everything is about exploitation and domination, and to think otherwise is to be blind or naïve.”As a result, he added, other countries “have to take seriously the articulated goals, however alarming.” That includes threats to seize Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, as well as demands for economic submission to tariffs that weaken the economies of allies. The European Union, which governs trade policies for its 27 member states, has been working for months on proposals for counter-tariffs if necessary. Those are designed to target areas of the United States that supported Mr. Trump in the last election. The United States is the E.U.’s largest trade partner, with nearly a trillion dollars of two-way trade last year, so new tariffs and counter-tariffs will have a dramatic impact on both sides, and sharply increase market uncertainty. Cars parked at Baltimore’s port, in February. European Union officials have already announced plans to place new tariffs on many American goods — from lingerie to soy products — by mid-April, while lifting suspension of previous countermeasures imposed on earlier tariff fights over steel and aluminum. That first wave, meant to hitAmerican whiskeyand motorcycles,was delayedto allow for more negotiations and over fears of astark American responsethat could crushEuropean wine and Champagne exports. More potent measures are now likely to follow. Ms. von der Leyen said late Wednesday that the European Union would “continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.”European countries, especially Germany, export many more cars to the United States than they import. Anger about this disparity has been a regular theme for Mr. Trump since the 1980s, long before he went into politics, when he often complained about the numbers of German and Japanese cars on American streets. The United States is the most important export market for Germany’s auto industry, and the largest three German carmakers make upabout 73 percentof the European Union’s automotive exports to the United States. Armin Laschet, a conservative who may become Germany’s next foreign minister, said a robust response to the tariffs must come from the European Union. A production line at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany, last year. Canadian officials — with an election weeks away — have issued a similar call for action. On Wednesday, Mr. Carney’s campaign brought him to the bridge at the border with Detroit over which $300 million worth of auto parts cross daily. He unveiled a series of promises for the auto industry including a two billion Canadian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to reshape it for a future without the United States. “We will defend our workers, we will defend our companies, we will defend our country, and we will defend it together,” he said. In Asia, officials had hoped for softer tariff treatment based on factories already being built in the United States at great expense. “We invest in America, employ people, and pay the highest wages,” Mr. Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, said. Mr. Trump with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan in the Oval Office, in February. And yet, at a moment when economic and military threats seem to be converging for Japan, analysts said his hands were tied: Because inflation is rising with a weakened Japanese yen, Japan cannot afford a trade spat that drives up consumer prices even further. And with a more militarized China on Japan’s doorstep,sending armed shipsto assert its claims to disputed islands in recent days, the prime minister is most keen to get a clear commitment from Mr. Trump to defend Japan’s security. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo this week. So far, the Trump administration has sent conflicting signals to America’s largest Asian ally. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reaffirmed support for Japan, the president himself has publicly questioned the two nations’ security alliance. “We are very much constrained at this moment,” said Ken Jimbo, a professor of international politics and security at Keio University. South Korea finds itself in a similar position; it has deepened its diplomatic and military dependence on the United States in recent years, as anti-Chinese sentiment rose among its people, and to strengthen deterrence against North Korea. South Koreans’ fundamental trust in the alliance will survive the latest tariffs, in part because the penalties didn’t target South Korea only but also hit competitors, said Park Won-gon, an expert in South Korea-U.S. relations at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. But cars are one of South Korea’s biggest export items, totaling $71 billion last year, and the United States was the destination for nearly half. The government called for a meeting with the car industry on Thursday to discuss a response to the tariffs. “The U.S. tariffs are expected to pose significant challenges for our automobile companies exporting a large volume to the U.S. market,” said Ahn Duk-geun, South Korea’s trade minister. On news portals from the left and right, many Koreans expressed outrage that the tariffs were landing just a few days after Hyundai Motor, a South Korean conglomerate,said itwould invest $21 billion to expand manufacturing in the United States. William Choong, a senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said that for many Asian allies, it feels as if the United States is a police commander “that sticks his Glock down the back of the junior cop — i.e. regional countries — and starts shaking him down for cash and other valuables.”Ian Austencontributed reporting from Windsor, Ontario;Choe Sang-Hunfrom Seoul;Martin Facklerfrom Tokyo;Emiliano Rodríguez Megafrom Mexico City, Mexico;Jeanna Smialekfrom Brussels; andMelissa EddyandChristopher F.

Trump Threatens Europe and Canada if They Band Together Against U.S. In a late-night social media post, the president said he would impose “large scale” tariffs if Canada and the European Union allied to “do economic harm” to America. President Trump said in a middle-of-the-night social media post early Thursday that he would come after the European Union and Canada if they banded together to “do economic harm” to America, opening a new front in the unfolding trade war. “If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Mr. Trump wrote. His threat creates a new problem for the European Union, which is already trying to respond to his tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and potentially a broader array of goods and services. Mr. Trump on Wednesday said that all cars and certain automobile parts that are shipped into the United States would be subject toa 25 percent tariff. The United States is by far Europe’s most important trading partner, and the prospect of worse trading conditions has left the European Union scrambling to negotiate. But the Trump administration has showed little appetite to strike a deal so far. “In the end, as it is said, one hand cannot clap,” Maros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Union,has saidThat has left Europeans seeking to strike new alliances and deepen existing trading relationships. And concerns about President Trump’s shifting stance on military support have driven partners like the European Union and Canada closer together. Canada is already working toward providing industrial support for Europe’s rearmament push. European Commission officials did not immediately comment on Mr. Trump’s post.

Thursday Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/europe/chat-russia-turkey.html,2025-03-27T04:40:54Z,World,Efforts to minimize the damage from a leaked Signal chat.,,,,,"Excerpts from the Signal chat between President Trump’s top aides. Thursday BriefingEfforts to minimize the damage from a leaked Signal chat. Newly released Signal texts showed what was at stakeMore messages were published yesterdayfrom a Signal group chat between President Trump’s top security officials that laid out plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen and that inadvertently included the editor in chief of The Atlantic. Read the annotated chat. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Trumpdismissed concernsabout the leak as a “witch hunt,” and he suggested that the messaging app was at fault for the journalist’s inclusion. Democrats have called for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to step down, saying he had behaved recklessly by revealing the precise timing of the strikes on Houthi targets and could have endangered American troops. He has not apologized, insisting instead that the information shared in the chat was not “war plans.”Technically, the exchanges did not include war plans, according to David Sanger, our White House correspondent who covers national security. But Hegseth’s descriptions were so detailed that the distinction may not have mattered, he added. “Had the chat leaked,” David said, “it could have given advance warning to the Houthis, who could have simply left the site and defeated the mission. They could have also prepared to launch against the planes, which would have put the pilots’ lives at risk.” (Read more about whatmakes information classified, andwhat a “war plan” really means.)Listen: The Atlantic journalist told The Dailywhat it was like to accidentally be included in the infamous group chatTrade war: Trump said that he wouldimpose a 25 percent tariffson all cars and certain automobile parts that are shipped into the U.S. Here’s how the measures could affect Europe.

Cease-fire talks are helping Russia buy timeConflicting statements from Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine this week on the state of cease-fire negotiations are the latest sign of a chaotic process in which, analysts and experts said, the Kremlinappears to be playing for timeand getting the upper hand. Deals for a truce in the Black Sea and to halt strikes on energy targets for 30 days both benefit Moscow more than Kyiv. And even President Trump has acknowledged that Russia may be intentionally stalling talks to further its own ends. Analysis: “There are a lot of doubts about whether Russia is seriously engaging in the talks or just running the clock,” said my colleague Paul Sonne, who covers Russia. “Judging by the statements that came out this week, there was very little that could be seen as a gain for Ukraine,” he added. The view from Europe: Despite projecting unity, leaders arestruggling to find the moneyto replace the bulk of the U.S. contribution to Ukraine and build up their own defense.

The arrest has set off nightly demonstrations that have drawn hundreds of thousands of antigovernment protesters to the streets of Istanbul and other cities, prompting a government crackdown.

"Europeans Vow to Stand by Ukraine, but Disagree Over Force Proposal",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/europe/european-leaders-ukraine-support.html,2025-03-27T04:01:30Z,World,President Emmanuel Macron of France insisted that a “reassurance force” of European troops after the war ends was still on the table. But details remained scarce.,Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022),"Macron, Emmanuel (1977- ); Zelensky, Volodymyr; Starmer, Keir",France; Paris (France); Europe,European Union,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain in Paris, on Thursday. Reporting from ParisEuropeans Vow to Stand by Ukraine, but Disagree Over Force ProposalPresident Emmanuel Macron of France insisted that a “reassurance force” of European troops after the war ends was still on the table. But details remained scarce. President Emmanuel Macron of France vowed on Thursday that a “coalition of the willing” would keep supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia and would help safeguard an eventual peace — including, for some European countries, by sending a “reassurance force” to Ukrainian soil after the conflict ends. But Mr. Macron, who spoke at the close of a gathering of European leaders in Paris, said the contours of that force were still being ironed out, and details of who was willing to do what were still scarce. That compounded a sense of murkiness around diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Even as the leaders met, Russia facedaccusations that it was drawing out U.S.-mediated negotiationsin Saudi Arabia to gain the upper hand. And it is an open question what role the United States would be willing to play to supporta European force stationed in Ukraine. “We need to accelerate discussions to obtain a cease-fire, we need to accelerate our ability to finance and deliver weapons, and to prepare plans for the Ukrainian army and the reassurance force,” Mr. Macron said at a news conference after the meeting. But after three hours of discussions, Britain and France were still the only countries committed to the idea. Russia has called it unacceptable. Clearing debris after a strike in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, last month. Maria V. Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that such a deployment would be “military intervention in Ukraine under the guise of a peacekeeping mission.”“It could lead to a direct military clash between Russia and NATO,” she added. Mr. Macron said any European force would not be on the front lines and would not be tasked with monitoring or enforcing a cease-fire. That job, he suggested, could fall to U.N. peacekeepers or other independent monitors, while European troops would be based farther from the front to deter Russia. The Europeans would also help train and support Ukrainian forces. Mr. Macron acknowledged that the leaders had not found “unanimity” on a reassurance force. Italy wants to send troops on the ground only if they are part of a U.N. mission, while Polandhas ruled it out entirely. Still, Mr. Macron said France and Britain would send military delegations to Ukraine to draw up plans for the Ukrainian army’s future and for the size and scope of a reassurance force, with more details expected within a month or so. “It’s these military-to-military exchanges that will define the locations, the number of forces to make it credible, and the capabilities,” Mr. Macron said. “Nothing has been ruled out yet. We’re looking at sea, air and land.”Thursday’s meeting came after similar gatherings by leaders and military chiefsin FranceandBritain,which are leading efforts to help Ukraine despite wavering American commitment. The leaders in Paris also promised to increase short-term military aid for Ukraine, Mr. Macron said, including by accelerating the disbursement of loans backed by Russian assetsthat were agreed upon last year“We also unanimously agreed that now was not the time to lift sanctions, whatever they may be,” he said. Mr. Macron vowed that a “coalition of the willing” would continue to stand by Ukraine in the war against Russia and would help safeguard an eventual peace. The Kremlin has said it would honor portions ofa deal on a cease-fire in the Black Sea that was struck this weekonly after Western countries removed restrictions on Russian agricultural exports — a demand that European countries have rejected. “It’s clear the Russians are filibustering,”Prime Minister Keir Starmerof Britain said at the meeting,according to his officePresident Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, hascalled the ideaof a European force in Ukraine “simplistic” and “a posture and a pose” — even though the Trump administration hasrepeatedly berated Europefor doing too little to defend itself. Mr. Trump has not shown any willingness to provide American guarantees of Ukrainian security, which Mr. Starmer has said would be required for most European countries to consider committing troops. When it came to U.S. support, Mr. Macron said, “you have to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.”Mr. Macron said he had spoken to Mr. Trump by phone before Thursday’s meeting and would brief him again afterward. He also seemed to appeal to Mr. Trump’s dislike of being on the bad end of a deal, suggesting that Russia — which, unlike Ukraine, hasnot agreed to an unconditional 30-day cease-fire— was flouting his efforts. “If that clear answer from Russia doesn’t come, President Trump will feel cheated, betrayed, rightly so, and then he’ll have to react,” Mr. Macron said. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine expressed satisfaction after the meeting, listing European promises to invest in Ukrainian drones and electronic warfare production, and to keep sanctions on Russia as long as the war continues. “I think all leaders are all charged up,” Mr. Zelensky said at a separate news conference. “I believe they won’t abandon us and will continue supporting Ukraine.”But he wished that plans for a cease-fire and security guarantees would move faster. “Unfortunately,” he said, “what we’d like to do in one week takes months to achieve.”Catherine Portercontributed reporting from Paris,Mark Landlerfrom London,Ivan Nechepurenkofrom Tbilisi, Georgia, andMaria Varenikovafrom Kyiv, Ukraine.

"As Musk Makes Some Headway in India, He Is Also Suing Its Government",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/asia/india-elon-musk-x-lawsuit-grok.html,2025-03-27T04:01:28Z,World,Elon Musk’s pursuit of business expansion in the country through Tesla and Starlink is coming at the same time that his X platform is waging a fight over free speech.,Freedom of Speech and Expression; Electric and Hybrid Vehicles; Politics and Government; Social Media; Suits and Litigation (Civil); Censorship; Customs (Tariff); Protectionism (Trade),"Musk, Elon; Modi, Narendra; Trump, Donald J",India,Space Exploration Technologies Corp; Starlink Satellite Constellation (SpaceX); Tesla Motors Inc; X (Formerly Twitter),"Elon Musk, second from right, during a meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, left, at the White House in February. Reporting from New DelhiAs Musk Makes Some Headway in India, He Is Also Suing Its GovernmentElon Musk’s pursuit of business expansion in the country through Tesla and Starlink is coming at the same time that his X platform is waging a fight over free speech. In recent weeks, Elon Musk has finally seemed to make some inroads in India, a potentially huge market whose government has frustrated him with its trade barriers. Tesla appears to be preparing another attemptto sell cars in the country, and Starlink, his satellite internet provider,signed partnershipswith two Indian companies. At the same time, though, Mr. Musk is picking a fight with the Indian government through another piece of his empire: his social media company, X. This month, X, formerly known as Twitter, filed a lawsuit in an Indian court accusing the government of misusing a law to block content on the site. While Mr. Musk has portrayed himself as a champion of free speech, it is a touchy subject for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has faced allegations of stifling dissent andclamping down on expression. A hearing in the lawsuit is expected Thursday. The platform’s chatbot, Grok, has also posed a challenge for Indian officials, who are scrutinizing it for potential violations of information technology laws, according to Indian media reports. Grok, which Mr. Musk has promoted as a straight-talking, “anti-woke” digital tool, has generated both mirth and outrage in India as it has spewed profanities in Hindi and made politically sensitive statements in response to user queries. For example, when users asked Grok about media bias,it repliedthat Mr. Modi’s party spends heavily to “sway narratives.” It added: “Media bias isn’t new, but the party’s grip has tightened since 2014, often silencing critical voices.”The free-speech campaign by Mr. Musk’s company has landed in the middle of a delicate moment for relations between Washington and New Delhi. A team from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is in India to discuss bilateral trade agreements. President Trump has pushed the Modi government to lower tariffs on American products, including cars and agricultural goods. If the two countries cannot come to an agreement by April 2, Mr. Trump has vowed to impose reciprocal levies. Mr. Musk is one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, and when Mr. Modi visited the White House last month, he met with Mr. Musk and his family. If the Modi government accommodates Mr. Trump’s tariff demands, Tesla could find its way into India more easily — a prime example of the billionaire’s unusualtangle of personal, political and business interestsin the country. Mr. Musk has sought to sell Teslas in India for years. After a failed attempt to enter the Indian market in 2021, the company recently began to pursue the opportunity anew, acquiring commercial spaces and moving to hire salespeople. Starlink, the telecommunications subsidiary of Mr. Musk’s space technology company, SpaceX, is further along in India. Until recently, Starlink, which provides internet connectivity via satellites, had been banned in the country. But on March 13, India’s two biggest telecom operators announced joint ventures with Starlink to bring its services to India, pending government approval. The announcement came exactly a month afterMr. Modi’s chatwith Mr. Musk in Washington. A photo released by the office of Mr. Modi shows India’s prime minister meeting with Mr. Musk and members of Mr. Musk’s family in the United States in February. Mr. Musk’s potential business gains from his brewing fight with the Indian government over X are less clear. The social media platform represents only a small fragment of Mr. Musk’s wealth, which Forbes pegs at $350 billion, with the bulk coming from SpaceX and Tesla. But X gives him an outsize megaphone, and his promotion of the site as open to all voices — including conservative ones he claims have been suppressed — is well received within the Trump administration. In a lawsuit filed on March 5 in the Indian state of Karnataka, X alleged that the Indian government’s broad use of a law to block content it deems objectionable violates the provisions of another law, which lays down the process for how and when information can be removed. In the suit, X also called the government’s “Sahyog Portal” — which automates the process of filing takedown orders for online posts by official bodies and local police — a “censorship” portal. Mr. Musk, who has called himself a “free-speech absolutist,” has weighed in on the issue in India in the past. “The rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict, and we can’t go beyond the laws of a country,” hetold the BBCin 2023. “If we have a choice of either our people go to prison or we comply with the laws, we’ll comply”Mr. Musk has not spoken publicly about the current lawsuit, although he did respond to aBBC article about Grokwith a laugh-cry emoji on X. Indian media reports have said that the government is questioning X over the use of profanity by Grok as it examines whether the chatbot has violated  laws. Asked whether its responses to user queries had caused trouble with the Indian government, Grok replied in the affirmative. “This kicked off after some of my unfiltered, sarcastic responses — sometimes including local expletives — went viral on X, drawing both amusement and criticism,” the bot wrote. “Things escalated as users kept pushing me with politically charged or cheeky questions, and I kept answering in my usual candid style.”Market Chaos and Economic Damage: A big hit to portfolios would befelt acutely by higher-income Americans, whose spending has recently been the biggest driver of the economy.

At the same time, Chinese and Japanese ships were facing off in disputed waters. David Pierson reported from Hong Kong. Martin Fackler and Hisako Ueno reported from Tokyo. China Is Courting, and Confronting, U.S. Allies Made Uneasy by TrumpNews AnalysisEven as China offers itself to nations like Japan as a more reliable partner, its ships are pushing into their neighborhoods — sometimes on the very same day. When China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Tokyo last weekend, he said China saw “great potential” for trade and stability if the three neighbors worked together. Citing what he called their shared “Oriental wisdom,” he quoted a proverb, seemingly alluding to the United States as an unreliable, distant ally: “Close neighbors are better than relatives far away.”But even as the officials were talking, two Chinese Coast Guard ships had begun an unusual incursion into waters near disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan’s coast guard, which moved to intercept them, said the Chinese ships were armed and had been pursuing a small Japanese fishing boat. Japan said the incursion, which lasted nearly four days, was China’s longest yet into the waters around the islands, which are claimed by both countries. Japan’s foreign minister said he had protested to Mr. Wang on Saturday about an increase in such activity around the uninhabited islands, which Japan calls the Senkaku and China calls the Diaoyu. China’s simultaneous pledges of friendship and deployment of armed ships reflect the two sides of Beijing’s strategy for dealing with a Trump administration that is rapidly recalibrating America’s place in the world. China is using a “carrots and sticks” approach with its neighbors, to “reward the policies of the target country that advantage Chinese interests and warn against those policies that are harmful to China,” saidBonnie S. Glaser, the managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based research institution. A Chinese Coast Guard ship near the Senkaku islands last year. The islands, controlled by Japan, are also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyu. On the one hand, as Mr. Trump alienates allies of the United States, including by imposing tariffs and, in Japan’s case, questioning the fairness of a defense treaty, China sees an opportunity to court those countries. On the other hand, China seems to have concluded that Mr. Trump’s abrasive foreign policy gives it leverage to advance its interests when so many U.S. allies are feeling vulnerable and questioning America’s reliability. “China sees Trump’s alienation of U.S. allies as providing an opportunity, but that doesn’t mean that Beijing will refrain from signaling their dissatisfaction when China’s core interests are being threatened,” Ms. Glaser said. That seems to be the case with Australia, which has had, at times, a tumultuous relationship with China. After Prime Minister Anthony Albanese took office in 2022, he moved to repair the relationship. Since then, China has lifted restrictions on a range of Australian exports, including wine, red meat and lobster. Last month, Chinese and Australian defense officials held high-level talks in Beijing for the first time in six years. But just days later, a Chinese naval flotilla begancircumnavigating Australia, unannounced. It conducted a live-fire drill in the area for the first time, forcing dozens of civilian flights to reroute. The exercises set off alarm in Australia and calls to re-evaluate its defenses. Some analysts said the drills were probably a response to the Australian Navy’s frequent voyages in the South China Sea, over which China claims sovereignty. Others said China could have been testing how the Trump administration would react to shows of force so close to one of America’s most trusted allies. Cadets on an Australian Navy ship. A Chinese naval flotilla recently raised alarms in Australia by sailing around the country and conducting live-fire drills. “Beijing may be trying to see what it can get away with,” hoping to establish a new norm for its operations in the region, saidJa Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. “I suppose one calculation is that if the United States is ineffective or paralyzed, the other actors are unable to do much on their own.”China has taken a similar hard-and-soft approach with South Korea and Vietnam. Its trade with Vietnam is flourishing, and it has indicated that it might soon lift an unofficial ban on K-pop entertainment from South Korea. But China held live-fire drills in the Gulf of Tonkin last month after Vietnam pressed territorial claims in those waters. And it deployed its coast guard near South Korea last week after a Korean vessel tried to inspect Chinese-built steel structures in the area. (South Korea lodged an official protest with Beijing over that incident.)Such assertive behavior is a reminder that despite the changing geopolitical currents, China remains committed to one of its primary goals, which is to become the dominant power in the Asia-Pacific region, saidRichard McGregor, a senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Sydney. “The waters near Japan, in the South China Sea and around Australia are all in a way parts of an indivisible theater of Chinese interests,” he said. “They are going to pursue those goals whatever the ups and downs with the U.S. are. The Chinese also calculate they can do both at the same time. They are embracing while fighting.”Japan’s relationship with China embodies those contradictions. The two countries’ ties have thawed in recent months. In January, the Chinese Communist Party’s diplomatic arm held talks with Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party for the first time in years. Both nations have loosened visa rules for each other’s tourists, and China has muted its objections to Japan’s release of treated radioactive water from the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Yet tensions persist. This month, Japan said it was considering putting long-range missiles on its southwestern island of Kyushu. Those missiles could target China’s forces if it tried to invade Taiwan, the de facto independent island claimed by Beijing. Minamikojima, left, an islet in the Senkakus. Japanese and Chinese ships confronted each other in its waters on Friday, beginning a standoff that lasted almost four days. Meanwhile, Japan says China has beensending more and more shipsinto waters near the Senkaku islands, which Japan controls, in what Japanese analysts call a strategy to slowly ratchet up challenges to the status quo. The latest incursion started before dawn on Friday, when two Chinese Coast Guard ships entered territorial waters around the islet of Minamikojima, apparently chasing a much smaller Japanese fishing boat. Japan’s coast guard said it sent ships to head off the Chinese vessels. The Japanese ships protected the fishing boat while demanding that the Chinese withdraw. The Chinese refused, beginning a 92-hour standoff in which the ships sailed side by side, each crew shouting claims to the islands at the other. At one point, two more Chinese ships briefly joined the fray. Japan’s coast guard said it finally “forced the Chinese Coast Guard ships to withdraw” late on Monday evening. It said China’s longest previous incursion, in 2023, had lasted almost 81 hours. A former Japanese Coast Guard commander, Atsushi Tohyama, called the recent incursion part of a strategy of attrition thatbegan in 2010, when a Chinese fishing trawler rammed a Japanese Coast Guard ship near the Senkakus. “They appear to have been provoked by the fishing boat,” Mr. Tohyama said of the Chinese ships involved in the latest standoff. “From what I’ve been told, the fishing boat stayed in waters around the island longer than usual, and the Chinese retaliated in kind.”“In a dispute like this, even the act of fishing becomes a declaration of sovereignty,” Mr. Tohyama said.

Officer Turned Double Agent, Dies at 86",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/oleg-gordievsky-dead.html,2025-03-26T19:28:57Z,World,"While climbing the ranks of the Soviet spy agency, he spent more than a decade working for British intelligence as one of its most highly placed moles.",Deaths (Obituaries); Espionage and Intelligence Services; International Relations; Cold War Era; Defectors (Political),"Gordievsky, Oleg",Great Britain; USSR (Former Soviet Union),KGB; British Secret Intelligence Service,"As the Cold War wound down, Mr. Gordievsky began writing under his own name, including the book “KGB: The Inside Story,” a collaboration with the historian Christopher Andrew. Oleg Gordievsky, K.G.B. Officer Turned Double Agent, Dies at 86Oleg Gordievsky in 1994. A longtime double agent for British intelligence, he was one of the most highly placed Western spies during the Cold War. While climbing the ranks of the Soviet spy agency, he spent more than a decade working for British intelligence as one of its most highly placed moles. Oleg Gordievsky, who was the top K.G.B. agent in London until he defected to the West in 1985 andrevealed himself as a longtime double agentfor British intelligence — making him one of the most highly placed Western spies during the Cold War — was found dead at his home in Godalming, southwest of London, on March 4. He was 86. The local police, who discovered his body, said that they did not believe foul play was involved but that an investigation was ongoing. The British foreign intelligence agency, MI6, first recruited Mr. Gordievsky in 1974, when he was based in Copenhagen. In 1982, he moved to London, where the K.G.B. tasked him with seeding disinformation about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher before the next year’s general election. Mr. Gordievsky in Copenhagen in 1976. After an initial posting in East Berlin, he did two tours at the Soviet Embassy there, with time in between to improve his spycraft. In practice he helped the British root out secret operatives and informants working for the Soviet Union. He kept up enough of a front to please his K.G.B. bosses in Moscow, who soon promoted him to rezident, or head agent, in Britain. He also played a crucial role in preventing what could have become World War III. By the early 1980s, the Soviets were convinced that the United States was planning a first-strike nuclear attack under the guise of a major NATO exercise, a suspicion underlined by President Ronald Reagan’s bellicose rhetoric. As NATO carried out the exercise, known as Able Archer 83, the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies moved onto a war footing. Historians consider this to have been the closest moment to world war since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Mr. Gordievsky was in a unique position to work both sides. He was able to persuade Moscow that an attack was not in fact imminent while also communicating Soviet fears to the British and the Americans. As a result, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan pared back their language, and future military exercises were more limited. All of this remained secret for years afterward, and in the meantime Mr. Gordievsky had to watch his back. In 1985, he was recalled to Moscow, given drugs and interrogated. Someone, it seemed, had tipped off the K.G.B. to the presence of a high-ranking mole in London. Lacking solid evidence, the Soviets placed him on leave. A few days later he appeared at 7 p.m. on a Moscow street corner, holding a shopping bag. A man soon passed, eating a candy bar. They locked eyes. That was the signal to activate Operation Pimlico, an emergency extraction. Mr. Gordievsky shook his K.G.B. tail and then hurried to the Finnish border. Two British agents, a man and a woman, along with their baby, awaited him there in their Ford Sierra. They placed him in the trunk, wrapped in a foil sheet to confuse heat detectors. When dogs at the border grew suspicious, the agents began to change the child’s diaper, filling the car with odors that threw the canines off Mr. Gordievsky’s scent. When they were finally across, they played Jean Sibelius’s “Finlandia” symphony on the car’s sound system, a signal to Mr. Gordievsky that he was safe. Back in Moscow, he was sentenced to death in absentia. That sentence has never been rescinded. Mr. Gordievsky was made a companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2007. Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky was born on Oct. 10, 1938, in Moscow. His father, Anton, was an agent with the N.K.V.D., the forerunner of the K.G.B., and his mother, Olga, was a statistician. His father was a committed Communist, but his mother quietly reviled the party, an attitude that greatly influenced her son. Still, there was no question where his future lay. He graduated from the elite Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1961, and he joined the K.G.B. two years later. After an initial posting in East Berlin, he did two tours at the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen, with time in between to improve his spycraft. But as he rose in the K.G.B. ranks, he grew disillusioned with Communism. In Germany he had seen the newly erected Berlin Wall split families, and from afar he had watched the Soviet Union crush thePrague Springmovement of 1968. Working on a suggestion by a double agent who was a former colleague of Mr. Gordievsky’s, British intelligence agents began to feel him out in Copenhagen. Once he turned, he was considered among the West’s prize assets — so prized that the Americans and even Mrs. Thatcher did not know his identity. The apartment building in Copenhagen where Mr. Gordievsky lived while working at the Soviet Embassy. While continuing to provide intelligence to Moscow — bits of low-value information fed to him by his MI6 handlers — he helped Western governments uncover spies within their ranks. Among them wereArne Treholt, a Norwegian diplomat, andMichael Bettaney, a British counterintelligence officer who in 1983 tried to pass classified documents to Arkady Guk, the rezident at the time. The ensuing scandal led the Soviets to recall Mr. Guk, opening the door for Mr. Gordievsky to replace him. Both sides in the Cold War used moles like Mr. Gordievsky to hunt for spies. It was later revealed that his cover was blown byAldrich Ames, a C.I.A. officer who began working for the Soviets in 1985. Mr. Gordievsky was one of the first double agents Mr. Ames exposed and one of the few who escaped; nearly a dozen others were executed. After defecting, Mr. Gordievsky lived under an assumed name in Godalming but continued to advise British intelligence. As the Cold War wound down, he began writing under his own name, including articles for The Daily Telegraph and the books “KGB: The Inside Story” (1990), a collaboration with the historian Christopher Andrew, and “Next Stop Execution: The Autobiography of Oleg Gordievsky” (1995). His story was also the subject of “The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War” (2018), by Ben Macintyre. Mr. Gordievsky’s first marriage, to Yelena Akopian, a fellow K.G.B. agent, ended in divorce. He married Leila Aliyeva in 1979. After defecting, Mr. Gordievsky spent years trying to get the Soviet Union to allow his wife and their two daughters, Mariya and Anna, to join him. They arrived in Britain in 1991, but the couple soon divorced. His survivors include his daughters. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Mr. Gordievsky raised alarms about the increasing authoritarian rule of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, including his deployment of a robust network of spies and subversives. When his friend and fellow defector Alexander Litvinenko wasfatally poisonedby Russian agents in London in 2006, Mr. Gordievsky began to fear for his life. When he fell ill and went into a temporary coma in 2008, he maintained that he, too, had been poisoned by Russian agents. Mr. Gordievsky continued to warn about renewed Russian espionage, saying that Britain had naïvely lowered its defenses. “It is easier than ever to work and recruit here,” he wrote in The Daily Telegraph in 2010. “If anything, the overall Russian espionage presence in Britain is now bigger and more active than in my time.”"
Russia Is Winning Concessions and Buying Time in Cease-Fire Talks,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-us-peace-talks.html,2025-03-26T19:11:06Z,World,"Moscow’s demands are slowing the process and giving it the advantage in talks with a deal-hungry United States, experts said.",Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022); Peace Process; Defense and Military Forces; United States International Relations; Embargoes and Sanctions,"Putin, Vladimir V; Trump, Donald J",Ukraine; Russia; Black Sea,,"The Black Sea port of Odesa, Ukraine, last year. Reporting from BerlinRussia Is Winning Concessions and Buying Time in Cease-Fire Talksnews analysisMoscow’s demands are slowing the process and giving it the advantage in talks with a deal-hungry United States, experts said. ​Ukraine thought it had a deal in place to suspend the fighting in the Black Sea immediately. Russia said economic sanctions would need to be lifted first. And the United States didn’t address the question of timing at all, merely repeating President Trump’s broad demand that the killing stop. The conflicting statements released this week after midlevel cease-fire negotiations in Saudi Arabia were the latest sign of a chaotic process in which, analysts and experts said, the Kremlin appears to be playing for time and getting the upper hand. The Trump administration has set out to secure a series of limited cease-fire deals, arguing that the modest agreements will pave the way for a broader truce and eventually a peace deal to end the conflict. But so far, these incremental deals have largely been a way for Russia to win concessions from Ukraine and good will from a White House eager to be seen as the peacemaker. On Tuesday, Moscow said it would agree to theBlack Sea truceonly if sanctions on its state agriculture bank, Rosselkhozbank, and other restrictions were lifted. If Washington agrees to those terms and pressures European allies to do the same, the proposed Black Sea deal would benefit Moscow more than Kyiv, experts said. The Black Sea negotiations followed another limited agreement brokered by Washington: a 30-day halt in strikes by Russia and Ukraine against energy targets. That deal also benefits Moscow, given the extensive damage Ukrainian strikes have inflicted on oil and gas installations across Russia, and it came with no clear enforcement mechanism. Both sides quickly accused each other of continuing such strikes. And earlier this month, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russiaeffectively rejecteda proposal for an overall 30-day cease-fire brokered by Washington and Kyiv. Mr. Putin set out conditions, including a freeze on Ukrainian personnel recruitment, military training and arms imports, that would have made Kyiv particularly vulnerable were fighting to resume. “It seems clear that the Russians are stalling, and they are very good at that,” said Daniel Fried, a former top U.S. diplomat and fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, who has negotiated with the Russians in the past. “The Russians are drawing this out and loading it with conditions to send us down a rabbit hole of complexity.”Mr. Trump on Tuesday acknowledged the Russian tactic without criticism. He thinks Moscow wants to see an end to the war, he said, “but it could be that they’re dragging their feet.”He then recalled taking the same approach himself in business negotiations in the past, when he didn’t want to sign a contract but wanted to “sort of stay in the game.”For Russia, staying in the talks has meant raising a series of demands, however unlikely some of them are to be met. Russia framed the proposed Black Sea deal as a way to revive a 2022 U.N.-backed deal that gave it some control over commercial shipping through the sea. That deal allowed Ukraine to export its grain through an agreed-upon shipping corridor, but also permitted Russia to inspect all commercial ships to ensure they did not carry weapons. Experts say Russia exploited that provision to stall Ukrainian seaborne exports. Grain awaiting export at a warehouse in Ukraine in 2023. After the deal collapsed in 2023, Ukraine successfully pushed the Russian Navy out of the western Black Sea to secure its own shipping corridor. The operation was so successful that seaborne grain exportsreturned to near-prewar levels, above the levels reached during the time of the U.N.-backed deal. Against that backdrop, Kyiv has no interest in acceding to Moscow’s demands, experts say. Mr. Fried noted that for a Black Sea deal to be seen as balanced, it would need to include a clear benefit to Kyiv, such as a commitment by the Russians to halt attacks on the southern port of Odesa or on all Ukrainian agriculture export facilities. The White House did not explicitly refer to such a commitment in its statements on Tuesday, which referred only to the elimination of “the use of force” in the Black Sea. The conditions set out by the Kremlin on Tuesday also introduced the possibility of the United States lifting sanctions as a precondition to Russian action — a move European Union leaders firmly oppose. Asked about the Black Sea negotiations on Wednesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said that Mr. Trump’s concept of “peace through strength” should not “begin with removing sanctions before having received or verified anything.”Mr. Fried said he saw no substantive concession on the Russian side that would merit such a step. “The Russians have managed to put this on the agenda, which means they have injected sanctions lifting as part of the early negotiating process,” Mr. Fried said. “Why is it in our interest to do that? What is the reciprocal move we are going to get from the Russians?”Mr. Trump has threatened Russia with consequences if it doesn’t pursue peace, but his administration so far hasn’t followed through. It has instead accepted and repeated Mr. Putin’s statements about wanting to end the conflict and talking up the possibilities of a renewed era of cooperation with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Tuesday that Moscow’s conditions on the Black Sea deal were further evidence of the Kremlin seeking more concessions while deceiving the United States about its real intentions. A Rosselkhozbank office in Moscow. Russia said it would agree to a preliminary deal if sanctions on the bank were lifted. Mr. Putin has shown few signs of backing off his aim to subdue Ukraine as a satellite nation under Russia’s thumb. He has regularly said that Russian forces are on the front foot on the battlefield and that a cease-fire would only benefit Kyiv. He does, however, want to continue the Trump administration’s rapid rapprochement with Moscow, pointing to joint economic projects that Russia and the United States could pursue. The conditions Moscow set on the Black Sea agreement have little chance of being met anytime soon. They included a demand to reconnect the Russian state agriculture bank to the international payment system known as Swift. That would require the cooperation of European countries that have been cut out of the talks. Alexander Kolyandr, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said removing sanctions from the bank would bring significant benefit to Moscow. “They definitely want a large state-owned bank outside of the sanctions, because the moment you have a financially kosher bank, you can do whatever you want,” he said. “They can clear transactions; they can move money between countries; they can pay for imports in dollars, which is always cheaper; and they can receive dollars for their exports.”Even if Moscow, Washington and Kyiv resolve the differences in their statements on the Black Sea deal, the discussed cease-fire would do little more than enshrine the status quo, said Andrey Sizov, director of Sovecon, an agriculture market analysis firm. Mr. Sizov noted that Ukraine has been exporting grain successfully through the Black Sea since late 2023, and Russia has been exporting both oil and grain, even though restrictions have made the activity more expensive for Moscow. He sees the current talks as a formalization of the existing arrangement. “It’s not a step ahead,” he said. “In my view, it shows that progress toward a full truce, toward a full cease-fire, is quite limited, if any.”Constant Méheutcontributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Turkey’s Opposition Calls for Boycott and Mass Rally After Istanbul Mayor’s Arrest,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-protests.html,2025-03-26T18:38:14Z,World,"To pressure President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the jailing of his top rival, the opposition wants Turks to boycott companies that back Mr. Erdogan and plans to organize a protest this weekend.","Demonstrations, Protests and Riots; Boycotts; Politics and Government; Elections; Mayors; Political Prisoners; Corruption (Institutional)","Erdogan, Recep Tayyip; Imamoglu, Ekrem",Turkey; Istanbul (Turkey),,"Members of the Istanbul City Council waved their fists and chanted slogans in support of Ekrem Imamoglu, the jailed mayor, after electing Nuri Aslan to run the city on an interim basis on Wednesday. Reporting from IstanbulTurkey’s Opposition Calls for Boycott and Mass Rally After Istanbul Mayor’s ArrestTo pressure President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the jailing of his top rival, the opposition wants Turks to boycott companies that back Mr. Erdogan and plans to organize a protest this weekend. One week after the Turkish governmentarrested the mayor of Istanbul, who is the top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the political opposition on Wednesday pressed new tactics to fight what it calledan assault on the country’s democracy. The arrest has set off nightly demonstrations that have drawn hundreds of thousands of antigovernment protesters to the streets of Istanbul and other cities. Now, Mr. Erdogan’s opponents are calling on Turks to boycott companies said to support Mr. Erdogan and vowing to organize a mass protest on Saturday in place of the smaller rallies. The shift in tactics — including holding public fast-breaking meals for people observing the Muslim holy month of Ramadan — came amid a government crackdown on protesters. The government has issued protest bans in major cities and limited access to social media sites; some protesters haveclashed with riot policeusing water cannons and pepper spray to clear them from the streets. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in recent days in connection with the demonstrations, the Interior Ministry said, and about 170 have been jailed pending trial. Those arrested included 11 journalists, some of whom remained in custody on Wednesday, including a photographer for Agence France-Presse. The turmoil began on March 18, when the police arrested Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, on accusations of corruption and support for terrorism. On Sunday, he wasdetained pending a trial on corruption charges and suspended from his post— the same day that his political party designated him as its candidate in the next presidential election. Crowds on Tuesday flashing mobile phone lights during a protest against the arrest of Mr. Imamoglu in Istanbul. The government has accused Mr. Imamoglu, 54, of leading a criminal organization in City Hall and accepting bribes, rigging bids and misusing citizens’ personal data. He has denied the charges. Mr. Erdogan has described the protesters, many of whom are university students, as violent vandals and has accused the country’s main opposition party of stirring up trouble to distract from the accusations against the mayor. “A great country like Turkey has a very small, very underdeveloped, very inadequate main opposition party,” Mr. Erdogan said on Monday. “It has become clear that you cannot trust them to run even a snack shop, let alone the state or the municipalities.”While some European leaders have called on Turkey to uphold the rule of law, senior White House officials have not publicly commented on Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest. President Trump complimented Turkey and Mr. Erdogan in a meeting on Tuesday with ambassadorial nominees. “Good place,”Mr. Trump said. “Good leader, too.”Antigovernment demonstrators took to the streets of Istanbul on Monday night. Riot police have used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse crowds. On Wednesday, Istanbul’s City Council elected an interim mayor — Nuri Aslan, who previously served as the council’s deputy head — to run the city of 16 million people while Mr. Imamoglu remained in detention. The opposition holds a majority on the council. The head of Mr. Imamoglu’s Republican People’s Party, Ozgur Ozel, has criticized pro-government news outlets for not sufficiently covering the protests. And the party has called for a boycott of Turkish businesses connected to those outlets. A website launched to coordinate the boycott lists the names and logos of 20 companies, including a number of television channels, a popular coffee chain, an online bookstore and a tour company owned by Mr. Erdogan’s tourism minister. Criticizing the call for a boycott, Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday accused the opposition of “sinking the economy” with its protests and being “so frenzied that they would throw the country and the nation into the fire.”Mr. Erdogan, 71, who has led Turkey as prime minister and president since 2003, is in his second presidential term, which expires in 2028. The Constitution bars him from running again unless Parliament calls for early elections, which are widely expected. Many in Turkey say they believe that the sudden moves against Mr. Imamoglu last week sought to exclude him from the presidential race before it begins. A protester in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Abu Bakr Bashir reported from London, Iyad Abuheweila from Istanbul, Hiba Yazbek from Jerusalem and Rawan Sheikh Ahmad from Haifa, Israel. Gazans Protest Against Hamas and War for a Second DayThe demonstrations, a rare show of dissent, appeared to have spread, reflecting frustration at the breakdown of a cease-fire with Israel. “We want to live,” said one supporter. Palestinians in Gaza protested against the war fora second straight dayon Wednesday and chanted slogans against Hamas, frustrated and angry over the collapse of a cease-fire with Israel that many had hoped would become permanent. The protests were rare shows of dissent against Hamas, the armed group that has ruled Gaza for 17 years with an iron fist and which started a 15-month war by leading the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Wednesday’s protests appeared to spread to more parts of Gaza than on Tuesday, according to video on social media and witnesses. Most of the demonstrations have been small so far. But the main ones on Tuesday and Wednesday in the heavily damaged northern town of Beit Lahiya appear to have drawn hundreds of people, according to witnesses. No crowd numbers could be independently verified, though videos showed significant gatherings. Smaller protests were held on Wednesday in Gaza City, also in the north, and in at least two locations in central Gaza — Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah. One participant in Deir al-Balah said nearly 300 people took part in the protest there, with no discernible Hamas presence. Some Gazans say the protests began as a spontaneous outpouring of emotion, but there were indications on Wednesday that they were becoming more organized. Over the past two days, there has been a notable increase in calls on social media from Palestinians inside Gaza to come out into the streets and demonstrate against Hamas’s rule and its conduct of the war with Israel. On Wednesday, hundreds of people gathered for the second straight day in Beit Lahiya, some chanting “Hamas out! Hamas is terrorism!” and “We want to live freely.” There was another smaller protest in Gaza City, also in the north, with chants against Hamas. Videos from the Tuesday protests, verified by The New York Times, showed groups of Gazans in the half-ruined streets of Beit Lahiya. Some carried signs that opposed the continuation of the war, while others chanted slogans calling for Hamas to get out. Said Lulu, a 38-year-old from Gaza City in the north who is now sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis, said on Wednesday that he had heard about the protest in Beit Lahiya the day before and had begun contacting other anti-Hamas political activists to call for more social-media protest. “I can tell you hundreds responded with ‘Yes! We are joining you,’” he said. “Many of the individuals who are members of big families are joining the protests,” he added. “If Hamas decides to use force against protesters, I am afraid protesters would use force back,” Mr. Lulu said. “Our demands are clear: End the war at any cost,” he said. “‘We want to live’ is our slogan,” he added. “This time is different, I believe. We have absolutely nothing to lose. We have lost everything already, so we are not afraid.”Most of the anti-Hamas protests have been small so far, but the main demonstrations on Tuesday and Wednesday in the heavily destroyed northern town of Beit Lahiya, appeared to have drawn hundreds of people. There have been few signs so far of any attempt by Hamas to crack down by force on the protests, as the group has done in the past. Hamas, for its part, is trying to channel Palestinian anger back in the direction of Israel. In a statement posted on its Telegram channel on Wednesday, Hamas said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel “bears full responsibility for the failure” of the cease-fire agreement. A senior Hamas official, Basem Naim, said in a post on social media on Wednesday that “all people have the right to scream in pain and raise their voices.” But he warned against exploiting “tragic humanitarian conditions” for political agendas or to absolve “the criminal aggressor,” meaning Israel. Gazans, at least publicly, tend to blame Israel for much of the death, destruction and hunger the war has brought. But at least some hold Hamas responsible, as well, for leading the attack that began the war, for holding hostages and for continuing to fight rather than giving up its power in exchange for a cease-fire. Eslam Rafat, a 21-year-old student from Beit Lahiya, said he joined the protests “to call for an end to the war, and an end to the genocide in Gaza, and nothing more.” He said that some of those who joined the protests were making political statements, but that they went out originally to call for an end to the war. “It pains me to see children lining up for several hours to get handout food that often runs out,” he added. The two-month cease-fire with Israel had brought the first sustained respite from more than a year of incessant bombardment and a ground war. Almost the entire population of Gaza — more than two million people — was displaced during the war and the Israeli offensive killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. Israel abandoned the truce last week and resumed its bombardment of Gaza in an attempt to pressure Hamas to free more of the remaining hostages still held in the territory. Leaders of prominent Palestinian clans and families in southern Gaza who oppose Hamas issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling on Palestinians in the territory to “launch a popular uprising against injustice,” and protest against Hamas. “Hamas must lift its hand from Gaza immediately and end this unjust blockade imposed on us due to decisions that do not represent us,” the statement said. “We call on you all to take to the streets and make our voice heard,” it added. “Gaza is not held hostage by anyone. Gaza will be liberated by the will of its people.”Protesters in Beit Lahiya chanted against Hamas. Almost the entire population of Gaza — more than two million people — was displaced during the war and the Israeli offensive killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. Abdel Hamid Abed al-Atti, a Palestinian journalist and former radio host who fled from Beit Lahiya to Egypt during the war, called for an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. “Enough — after a year and a half of war,” he said in a widely viewed video. Mr. Abed al-Atti, who said he lost many family members to Israeli attacks during the war, said Gazans were protesting out of an overwhelming sense of anger after so much loss and destruction. “This was spontaneous,” he added in a phone call. “These days, Gazans have nothing left to lose.”Amin Abed, a Palestinian activist from Gaza who spent the early part of the war in Gaza and was evacuated to the United Arab Emirates for medical treatment in September last year, said the protesters’ main demand was for Hamas to step down. “People are exhausted,” Mr. Abed told The New York Times in a phone interview on Wednesday. “They want to live in peace, safety, and stability, away from war and death. They want dignity,” he added. “This movement is proof,” Mr. Abed said. “It refutes the Israeli narrative that all of Gaza is Hamas.”Munther al-Hayek, the Gaza-based spokesman for the Palestinian Fatah faction, a rival to Hamas, called on Hamas “to listen to the voice of our people and withdraw from the government” in Gaza. Speaking in an interview with Palestinian radio on Wednesday, he said Hamas should hand over power to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Mr. al-Hayek said Hamas’s presence “has become dangerous to the Palestinian cause,” adding that the movement should listen to the voices emerging in Gaza and save the devastated population. Mr. Netanyahu also took note of the protests in Gaza. “In recent days, we have witnessed a new shift — something we have never seen before,” he said on Wednesday in remarks to Israel’s Parliament. “We saw large, open protests in the Gaza Strip against Hamas rule.”Nader Ibrahimcontributed reporting from London.

Prince Harry Steps Down as Patron of Charity He Founded,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/prince-harry-resigns-charity-sentebale.html,2025-03-26T16:41:07Z,World,"The prince and his fellow patron, the prince of Lesotho, said they had resigned in solidarity with trustees at the charity, Sentebale.",Whistle-Blowers; Philanthropy,"Harry, Duke of Sussex; Seeiso, Prince of Lesotho (1966- ); Chandauka, Sophie",Lesotho; Great Britain,Sentebale,"Prince Harry with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. They said they would always regard themselves as founders of the charity, Sentebale. Reporting from LondonPrince Harry Steps Down as Patron of Charity He FoundedThe prince and his fellow patron, the prince of Lesotho, said they had resigned in solidarity with trustees at the charity, Sentebale. Prince Harry has resigned as the patron of a charity he founded in southern Africa, his office said in a statement on Wednesday. The move followed a clash between the charity’s board of trustees and its board chair. Harry and his fellow patron, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, said they were quitting as faces of the charity, Sentebale, which is registered in Britain but operates in southern Africa, in solidarity with its board of trustees. Five of the board’s nine members resigned this week. “It is devastating that the relationship between the charity’s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,” the two princes said in a joint statement. They added: “We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale’s beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”Harry established Sentebale with Seeiso, the younger brother of King Letsie III of Lesotho, in 2006. Founded in honor of Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, the charity raised funds for communities affected by the H.I.V. pandemic in Lesotho, a small landlocked kingdom that is one of the world’s poorest countries. In 2019, it expanded its work into nearby Botswana, and to addressing substance abuse, gender-based violence and other social ills among young people. In recent months, the organization’s leadership has been at loggerheads. The five trustees who resigned said in a joint statement that they had called on the board’s chair, Sophie Chandauka, to resign from her position, after losing “trust and confidence” in her. They said that Ms. Chandauka had responded by filing a lawsuit in Britain “to block us from voting her out,” and that they were resigning to avoid burdening the charity with the cost of the suit. “We could not in good conscience allow Sentebale to undertake that legal and financial burden and have been left with no other option but to vacate our positions,” they said. “This was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity.”Ms. Chandauka said in a statement that she had acted to expose what she described as “issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir,” a term referring to pointed sexism toward Black women, “and the coverup that ensued.” In addition to filing a case in an English court, she said, she had reported the trustees to Britain’s Charity Commission. “There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,” she said in her statement. Harry haspreviously brought high-profile legal casesagainst British newspapers. Ms. Chandauka, a lawyer based in New York City, served on the Sentebale board from 2009 to 2015, and was appointed as its chair in July 2023. Her role now, she said, would focus on securing wider streams of funding for the organization. The charity said in a statement on Wednesday that it had restructured its board under the leadership of Ms. Chandauka as part of a “transformation agenda” that would broaden the scope of its work to include business development and climate resilience in southern Africa. The princes’ statement did not specifically address the allegations leveled by Ms. Chandauka. “Although we may no longer be patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care,” the princes said. A spokeswoman for the Charity Commission said that the regulator was “assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.”Hang 10 in Hong Kong: With the Chinese territory's unexciting waters, one surfer says it’s all about “turning nothing into something.”Islamist Hard-Liners in Bangladesh: A brewing shift toward religious conservatismhas emerged from the political vacuumin the country of 175 million people.

As the article correctly noted, it is Pabrade, not Prabade. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Maj. Robin Bruce, a 1st Armored Division engineer. She is a woman, not a man. Engineers have been working since Wednesday to extract a U.S. military vehicle from a swamp in Lithuania, near the Belarus border. Recovering 4 Soldiers From Lithuanian Swamp Is ‘Incredibly Complex,’ Army SaysThe soldiers were on a training mission Tuesday when their heavy vehicle sank in a swamp in eastern Lithuania, near the border with Belarus, the Army said. A heavy vehicle that was carrying four U.S. Army soldiers remained submerged in a swamp in Lithuania on Thursday, two days after the soldiers were reported missing after they did not return from a training mission, the U.S. military said. The vehicle was discovered on Wednesday after a search by the U.S. Army, the Lithuanian military and other Lithuanian authorities, the U.S. military said. The soldiers still had not been found on Thursday because the Army was struggling to extract the vehicle from the mud. “The challenges presented by the water, thick mud and soft ground around the site have complicated recovery efforts and have required specialized equipment to drain water from the side and stabilize the ground,” the Army said ina statementon Thursday. Engineers on the site were building berms — barriers made of dirt and sand — to create a contained area from which water could be pumped and mud dredged, allowing emergency workers to access the vehicle, the Army said. “Due to the terrain, this is an incredibly complex engineering effort,” Maj. Robin Bruce, a 1st Armored Division engineer, said in the Army statement. She added, “The team is exploring every available option to speed up this process.”The soldiers, from the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, were training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus, early Tuesday,the U.S. military said. They had been sent out in an M88 Hercules, essentially a giant armored tow truck, to extract another Army vehicle, the military said. They may have driven off the road and into the swamp, according to a U.S. Army official in Europe. The soldiers appeared to have been trapped inside as the M88 sank, the official said. Water, thick mud and soft ground around the site had complicated the recovery effort, the Army said. The Third Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart in Georgia, was keeping the families of the soldiers informed on the status of the search, the U.S. military said. “This tragic situation weighs heavily on all of us, and we’re keeping the families, friends and teammates of our soldiers and recovery team in our thoughts and prayers,” Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, the commanding general of First Armored Division, said on Thursday. The initial search for the soldiers, through thick forests and swampy terrain, involved hundreds of American and Lithuanian soldiers and law enforcement officers, Lithuanian military helicopters and dive teams, the Army said. “We are incredibly appreciative of the dedicated and professional efforts of our Lithuanian allies in ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel,” General Taylor said. “They have worked tirelessly alongside us over the last 48 hours and we continue to be grateful for their support.”Lithuania’s defense minister, Dovile Sakaliene, met with American military commanders and said the country would provide whatever resources were necessary to help in the search. In a statementon social media, Ms. Sakaliene called the American soldiers “OUR soldiers and friends.”President Trump said on Wednesday that he had not been briefed on the situation and appeared to be unaware of the search for the soldiers. The U.S. military often conducts training missions in Lithuania,a NATO memberand staunch ally of Ukraine in its war against Russia.

British authorities issued a record fine against one of the country’s universities on Wednesday for issues including failing to “uphold the freedom of speech and academic freedom” in a policy statement on transgender equality, an escalation in the debate over student and staff rights on campus. The Office for Students, the regulator for higher education in England,imposeda penalty of 585,000 pounds, more than $755,000, on the University of Sussex. The fine followed an investigation into the university that began more than three years ago after Kathleen Stock, a philosophy professor, resigned saying that she had faced a campaign of harassment from students and activists over her views on gender identity. The fine from the regulator, the Office for Students, comes amid fraught conversations about bothtrans rightsand free speech on campuses in the United States and Britain, with many universities trying to balance the right of free expression with preventing hate speech. Dr. Stockquitin 2021 after she was accused of being transphobic by students and activists for arguing that transgender women were not women. Shesaidshe faced a campaign of harassment, bullying and character assassination before quitting. The university publicly defended Dr. Stock at the time. But on Wednesday, the Office for Students said the university’spolicy statementon trans and nonbinary equality had created a “chilling effect” that could cause students and staff members to “self-censor.”The regulator said this included requiring course materials to “positively represent trans people and trans lives.” It also penalized the school for failures in government and management processes. A university’s governing documents “should uphold principles of free speech and academic freedom,” Arif Ahmed, the regulator’s director of free speech and academic freedom, said. He added that the university’s policy “restricted” speech, teaching and learning, and that Dr. Stock withheld materials from her students that she otherwise would have included as a result. “Nothing in our approach has anything to do with taking sides on this issue,” he said, arguing that the regulator was concerned only with speech issues and neutral on issues of gender. The university condemned the ruling, saying in astatementthat it would make it impossible to create “policies to prevent abusive, bullying and harassing speech.” Sasha Roseneil, the university’s vice chancellor, promised to mount a legal challenge and said the regulator was mandating “libertarian free-speech absolutism as the fundamental principle for U.K. universities” and was “perpetuating the culture wars.”Kathleen Stock resigned from the University of Sussex after saying she had been bullied and accused of being transphobic. President Trump madetransgender issuesa campaign focus and in February effectivelybannedtrans athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The administration has also been accused oftargeting universitiesover their transgender policies. The British governmentsaid in Januarythat it would implement a new law to bolster academic freedom on campuses, but scrapped a provision that would have allowed anyone who claimed that their free speech had been restricted to take legal action against a university. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday that the new measures were necessary to ensure that “students and academics are not muzzled by the chilling effect demonstrated in this case.”“Free speech and academic freedom are non-negotiables in our universities, and I have been clear that where those principles are not upheld, robust action will be taken,” she said. The fine imposed on the University of Sussex is the most significant demonstration yet of the regulator’s mandate. Dr. Roseneil said the method of the investigation was “completely unacceptable,” because the regulator had not spoken with any university employees andmet only with Dr. Stock. She also called the fine “wholly disproportionate.”The university framed the ruling as part of longstanding tensions between the higher education industry and the regulator. In 2023, a report by a committee in the House of Lords, the appointed upper chamber of Britain’s Parliament,foundthat the regulator’s approach was “arbitrary, overly controlling and unnecessarily combative.” In 2024, a government-commissionedreviewfound that it was seen as “adversarial and overly legalistic.”Dr. Ahmed, who was appointed under the previous Conservative government, defended the investigation and said that the findings were “robust and are based on strong evidence.”He added that the Office for Students had reviewed the university’s governing documents, which showed that the school had breached the regulator’s rules, and did not need to interview employees. “We think that the evidence that we got — and the kind of evidence that we got — was suitable for the things that we were seeking,” he said. Dr. Stock did not respond to a request for comment.

Jair Bolsonaro Ordered to Face Trial in Brazil for Attempting a Coup,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-trial-coup-2022-elections.html,2025-03-26T16:03:23Z,World,Brazil’s top court ruled that the former president will be tried over his role in a vast plot to cling to power after his 2022 election loss.,Politics and Government; Coups D'Etat and Attempted Coups D'Etat; Assassinations and Attempted Assassinations; Decisions and Verdicts; Democracy (Theory and Philosophy),"Bolsonaro, Jair (1955- ); Moraes, Alexandre de (1968- ); Da Silva, Luiz Inacio Lula",Brazil,Supreme Federal Court (Brazil),"Former president Jair Bolsonaro greeting supporters at a rally on March 16 in Rio de Janeiro. Reporting from Rio de JaneiroJair Bolsonaro Ordered to Face Trial in Brazil for Attempting a CoupBrazil’s top court ruled that the former president will be tried over his role in a vast plot to cling to power after his 2022 election loss. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former president, will face trial on charges that he oversaw a vast scheme to cling to power after losing the 2022 elections, including an attempt to overturn the vote and a plot to assassinate the nation’s president-elect, the country’s Supreme Court decided on Wednesday. The ruling marks a significant effort to hold Mr. Bolsonaro accountable for accusations that he sought to effectively dismantle Brazil’s democracy by orchestrating a broad plan to stage a coup. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, said in explaining his decision that there was no doubt Mr. Bolsonaro “knew, handled and discussed” plans for a coup. Mr. Bolsonaro and seven members of his inner circle, including his running mate and a former spy chief, will be tried on charges filed by prosecutorslast monthof “violent abolition of the democratic rule of law” and “coup d’état,” among other crimes. In a surprise move, Mr. Bolsonaro attended the first day of the two-day hearing alongside his lawyers but remained silent. Mr. Bolsonaro, in a statement, said the court’s decision was politically motivated, calling it an attempt to “silence the opposition.”Mr. Bolsonaro, who has been barred from running for office until 2030, added that the president should be chosen by Brazilians “at the ballot box, not a handful of judges in a courtroom.”Celso Sanchez Vilardi, one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s lawyers, did not deny the existence of a coup plot, calling the details of the plan “very serious” in his argument before the high court. But he insisted that there was no link between Mr. Bolsonaro and the scheme. “Bolsonaro is the most investigated president in the country’s history,” Mr. Vilardi told the court. “Absolutely nothing has been found.”The five-justice Supreme Court panel voted unanimously to move forward with a trial. The trial, which has yet to be scheduled, is the fruit of a sweeping two-year investigation in which the police raided homes and offices, arrested people close to Mr. Bolsonaro and secured a key confession from a senior aide to the former president. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, said in explaining his decision that there was no doubt Mr. Bolsonaro “knew, handled and discussed’’ plans for a coup. In a 884-page report unsealedlast November, investigators accused Mr. Bolsonaro of directing and approving a detailed plot, which included plans to annul the election results, disband courts, grant special powers to the military and poison President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva days before he was to take office. Justice Moraes, who is seen by the far-right as an opponent of Mr. Bolsonaro, was himself the target of assassination plans revealed by the coup probe. The investigation revealed how close Brazil came to returning to a military dictatorship nearly four decades into its history as a modern democracy. The scheme, according to prosecutors, also includedsowing unfounded doubtsabout the reliability of Brazil’s electronic voting machines in the months leading up to the 2022 vote. Mr. Bolsonaro claimed he could only lose if the election were rigged in his opponent’s favor. After Mr. Bolsonaro lost, he and his allies encouraged right-wing protesters to camp out in front of military barracks across the nation, demanding that the army overturn the results. A week after Mr. Lula took office, many of those protesters stormedBrazil’s halls of powerin an episode that echoed the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters of President Trump. Experts say it is unlikely that Mr. Bolsonaro will be arrested ahead of his trial, unless Justice Moraes deems him to be a flight risk. After the police searched Mr. Bolsonaro’s home and seized his passport last year,he spent two nightsin the Hungarian Embassy in Brazil, raising questions over whether he had sought to use his ties with a fellow right-wing leader as leverage to evade possible arrest. If convicted, Mr. Bolsonaro could face 12 to 40 years in prison, according to the indictment, though political analysts expect any sentence to be shorter. A conviction would also make him permanently ineligible to run for office under current law. In an attempt to save Mr. Bolsonaro’s political future, lawmakers allied with the former president have tried to amend a Brazilian law that prohibits convicted criminals from running for office. They have also pushed for a new bill that would pardon those convicted over the Jan. 8, 2023 insurrection in Brazil’s capital, which could also benefit Mr. Bolsonaro’s efforts to run again. Mr. Bolsonaro also appears to be placing a bet on support from Mr. Trump. Last week, one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s sons said that he plans toseek political asylumin the United States and lobby the Trump administration to pressure Brazilian authorities to halt what he calls the unjust pursuit of his father. Last month, just hours after Brazilian prosecutors indicted Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. Trump’s media companysued Justice Moraes,the judge overseeing the case, in U.S. federal court, accusing him of illegally censoring right-wing voices on social media.

In dramatic scenes that appear to mark a turning point in nearly two years of civil war, Sudan’s military is driving fighters of its rival, the Rapid Support Forces, out of Khartoum. Paramilitary fighters with Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces withdrew in large numbers from the battered capital of Khartoum on Wednesday, fleeing a city they had occupied since a ruinous war broke out nearly two years ago. “Khartoum is now free,” declared Sudan’s military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who arrived by helicopter for a brief visit to the battle-ravaged presidential palace, which his forces had seized days earlier. Residents poured onto the street, cheering soldiers, in Burri, a neighborhood by the Nile “One army, one people,” they chanted. Soldiers combed through newly captured areas, hunting for paramilitary stragglers, some of whom were beaten. The capture of the capital by Sudan’s military marked a momentous shift in Africa’s largest war, which has brought massacres, famine and sweeping destruction in its wake. But it is unlikely to end the war. The Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., is likely to regroup in Darfur, its stronghold in Sudan’s far west, analysts said, where it has vowed to establish a parallel government and continue to prosecute the war. Civilians in the Burri neighborhood of Khartoum celebrating as they greeted Sudanese army troops on Wednesday. Drone footage circulated by Sudan’s military in the morning showed hundreds of R.S.F. fighters fleeing across a dam on the Nile at Jebel Aulia, 25 miles south of the capital — their last remaining escape route. By afternoon, it was clear they had been routed. The military announced it had captured a large R.S.F. base near the dam and was pursuing the remaining R.S.F. forces across the city. “A few remnants remain in pockets here and there,” said Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah, a military spokesman. “They will soon be destroyed.”The loss of Khartoum, one of the largest cities on the African continent, dealt a crushing blow to both the R.S.F. and to the ambitions of its foreign sponsors, in particular the United Arab Emirates, which hassupplied it with powerful weaponssince the start of the war. General al-Burhan, who leads Sudan’s military, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, who leads the Rapid Support Forces were once allies, butwent to war nearly two years agoover a dispute about a plan for the paramilitary troops to be absorbed by the military. The fighting has killed an estimated 150,000 people and displaced more than 13 million, sending nearly four million fleeing to neighboring countries — amounting to the world’s largest displacement crisis. Refugees have told of fleeing rapes, massacres and starvation. Civilians in Khartoum speaking on Wednesday with a Sudanese intelligence officer after paramilitary fighters were driven out. As the retreat unfolded across Khartoum on Wednesday, a city warped and destroyed by two years of war suddenly opened up. At the Manshia Bridge, a strategic crossing in the city center, Sudanese soldiers strolled over the Blue Nile early Wednesday without a fight, said Walid Ahmed, 43, a soldier standing guard. “The battle for the palace finished them off,” he said. “They lost their morale.”In a nearby residential area, residents whooped and cheered as they ran up to a group of soldiers. Several residents said they were deeply relieved that the paramilitaries had gone. “Are you going to stay with us this time? Or will you leave again?” implored Eman Elbagir to one officer. “We’ve had enough of the abuses. We’ve had enough of the looting. We can’t even sleep at night.”Another woman, Amira Elamin, said women suffered some of the worst abuses under the R.S.F., whose forces included mercenaries from Chad and Libya. “They took our daughters to the room,” she said, using a euphemism for sexual assault. “We were screaming and shouting. We said. ‘Don’t take our daughters! Take us instead!’”But, she added, “It was no use.”Both sides in Sudan’s war have been accused of atrocities, and there are fears that the capture of Khartoum could bring a fresh litany of abuses. Sudanese military fighters walking out of the heavily damaged presidential palace on Sunday, days after its recapture from the R.S.F. A few streets away, a soldier stood over two men, their hands bound, squirming in the dust. Soldiers said the two men were suspected of being R.S.F. sympathizers or troops. One soldier kicked the men on the ground. Yard away, other soldiers fired their weapons as they tried to flush other suspects from a house. Video footage verified by The New York Times appeared to show a fighter from Bara Ibn Malik, an Islamist militia that fights alongside the military,thrashing eight blindfolded menwith a hose about 10 miles from the city center.

Since then, the army steadily seized control of the capital, fighting as it retreated. Times journalists heard explosions and gunfire as they walked through the deserted city center on Tuesday. By Wednesday, the army had taken the city’s international airport, and continued to press south. Now the last concentration of R.S.F. fighters in Khartoum appeared to be in the Omdurman, on the west bank of the Nile, which is divided between army and R.S.F. control. After nightfall on Wednesday, a burst of artillery was heard across Omdurman. It was not immediately clear which side had fired.

Israel’s New Spending Plan Is a Win for Netanyahu,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/middleeast/israel-budget-netanyahu.html,2025-03-26T12:58:16Z,World,A budget approved by Israel’s Parliament cements Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s power and includes significant military spending.,Budgets and Budgeting; Israel-Gaza War (2023- ); Kidnapping and Hostages,"Netanyahu, Benjamin; Lapid, Yair; Smotrich, Bezalel (1980- )",Israel,,"Israeli military vehicles along the border with the Gaza Strip in southern Israel last week.

Israel’s New Spending Plan Is a Win for NetanyahuA budget approved by Israel’s Parliament cements Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s power and includes significant military spending. A spending plan approved by Israel’s Parliament hands Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a big political victory and devotes a significant chunk to military spending, signaling that Israel expects to stay on a war footing for the longer term. The $206 billion budget was approved on Tuesday with broad enough support — 66 votes to 52 — to shore up Mr. Netanyahu’s power after more than a year ofpublic backlash over Israeli hostages, sharp political opposition and legal challenges. The passing of the budget has profound political as well as financial implications. Had it failed to pass by the end of the month, Parliament would have been automatically disbanded. That would have set off elections, some 18 months early, that Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition of right-wing parties might have lost, according to most recent polls. Now, Mr. Netanyahu has much greater leeway to set his government’s priorities, both at home and in Gaza, because it will be harder for any single disgruntled party in his coalition to threaten its downfall. “That could mean doubling down on extreme right-wing populism and the war in Gaza, or it could mean figuring out an exit strategy and attempting a dash to a Saudi normalization deal,” said Michael Koplow, an analyst at Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group. “But whichever path it is will reflect Netanyahu’s own calculations rather than what he is being pushed into by his coalition partners.”Mr. Netanyahu’s partners were likely disinclined to break up the coalition in any case, at least for now, political analysts said. Some of his right-wing allies had seen their parties sink in the polls, while others — like the ultra-Orthodox — could struggle to find an alternative path to power despite disagreements with Mr. Netanyahu, they said. On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition was already preparing its next move: Its lawmakers were set to pass a new law that would give the government greater say in the selection of Supreme Court justices. The contentious proposal has attracted fierce opposition because it is seen as part of a wider push by Mr. Netanyahu’s government toexert more control over the judiciaryand other state watchdogs. The budget vote drew sharp protests from demonstrators, who blocked roads to the Parliament, holding signs to demand that Mr. Netanyahu move more quickly in negotiations to free several dozen hostages who have been held in the Gaza Strip for nearly 18 months. Talks to resume a cease-fire with Hamas appear stalled, and a recent government decision toreturn to waris raising fears among Israelis for the hostages who have not been released. Protesters and police officers outside the Parliament in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s parliamentary opposition, claimed the budget also included cuts to essential services like health care, welfare and education while diverting funds to Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners. “The budget harms every Israeli citizen, especially working people,” Mr. Lapid said. “Just to keep the coalition going for a few more months, it sells out the citizens of Israel.”The budget capped program spending at $168.8 billion (the rest goes to capital and debt expenses), allocating more money — $29.9 billion — to Israel’s defense ministry than any other government agency. Nearly 18 percent ofthe newly approved budget for 2025will fund its military and defense operations. A summary of the budget said that allocation reflected the continuing need for significant military spending since October 2023, when the Hamas-led assault that killed about 1,200 Israelis touched off the ongoing war in Gaza. Spending increased last year, the budget said, as Israel opened new fronts in Lebanon and Syria and stepped up airstrikes against Iran and Yemen. “This is a war budget, and with God’s help it will also be the victory budget,” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, an ally of Mr. Netanyahu, said in a statement after the budget was approved on Tuesday. The United States, which is part of deadlocked peace negotiations to free the Israeli hostages and end the war in Gaza, has eased some of Israel’s wartime expenses by supplying billions of dollars in weapons. Already this year, the Trump administration has bypassed Congress to allow the sales of more than$12 billionin armsto Israel over the coming decade — including$2 billion in bombslike the 2,000-pound munition that human rights officials and advocates said had indiscriminately killed civilians in Gaza.

Russia and Ukraine Commit to Black Sea Truce.

Both Russia and Ukraine rely on the sea for commodity exports, which have been hampered during the war. Ivan Nechepurenko reported from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine Commit to Black Sea Truce. What Does That Mean? It remains unclear if the commitments to stop attacks and ensure safe shipping in the Black Sea, which came with many caveats, would happen soon. Russia and Ukraine have said they are committed tocease fighting in the Black Sea, but it remains unclear whether an agreement can come into force soon — if at all. Russia had a major caveat: it would abide by the deal only after various restrictions were removed from its agricultural exports. The penalties were imposed by the United States and the European Union, and removing them would be an arduous process. Kyiv and Moscow also appear to have different interpretations of the U.S.-brokered agreement announced on Tuesday. Russiaframed itas a way to revive a 2022 U.N.-backed deal giving it some control over commercial shipping through the sea. Kyiv, however,insisted thatit would not allow the Russian Navy back into the western Black Sea, which Ukraine uses at its main seaborne export route. Underscoring the mistrust between the two countries, each side accused the other of breaching the truce on Wednesday. Ukraine reported an attack on its port city of Mykolaiv, while Moscow said it shot down two Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea. Russia’s conditions highlighted how it is in no hurry to end the war. With a sympathetic administration in the White House and as its forces have the upper hand on the battlefield, Moscow has been determined to get as many concessions as possible. What were Russia’s terms? TheKremlin saidit would not agree to a maritime cease-fire deal unless its state agriculture bank and other financial institutions involved in the trade of food and fertilizers were reconnected to the international payment system known as Swift. The system has its headquarters in Belgium, meaning that the United States would need to press European regulators to agree. Ina statementabout the deal, the White House pledged that it would “help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports.”Moscow said it also wanted Western companies to restore deliveries of agricultural equipment to Russia and sanctions removed against its companies, ships and insurers involved in the food and fertilizer trade. Russia says its exports of grain and fertilizers reached $45 billion in 2023. Even during the war, Russia has been exporting record-high volumes of grain and fertilizers, said Andrei Sizov, director of SovEcon, a Russian consultancy. A grain terminal near the Black Sea in Novorossiysk, Russia, in 2022. If sanctions were lifted against a Russian state bank, the Kremlin could use it for other transactions, too, said Aleksandr Kolyandr, a Russia analyst at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “The minute you have a sanctions-free bank, you can use it for whatever you want,” Mr. Kolyandr said. “It can be an instrument to crack the sanctions regime,” he said, but “it is much easier to monitor just one bank.”What is Ukraine’s position? While Kyiv said it would comply with the maritime cease-fire, it remains skeptical about Moscow’s intentions. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russia’s demand for lifting sanctions showed that it was “already trying to distort agreements.”Mr. Zelensky also said the U.S. commitment to help bolster Russian agricultural exports was “a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions.”Given Russia’s demands and the differing interpretations both sides have of the deal, it remains unclear what Ukraine stand to gain. Experts note the White House did not say whether the deal would protect Ukrainian ports from Russian attacks and enable the reopening of the ports of Mykolaiv and Kherson — two demands that Ukraine had pushed for during negotiations. The port of Mykolaiv, Ukraine, in 2022. Kyiv also has little interest in returning to the 2022 U.N.-backed agreement that Russia wants to revive. The deal allowed Ukraine to export its grain through an agreed upon Black Sea corridor, and Russia to inspect all commercial ships to ensure that they did not carry weapons. But Andrii Klymenko, the head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, said the inspections delayed exports so much that it made the route unprofitable. After Russia backed out of the deal, Ukraine secured its own shipping corridor bypushing the Russian Navy out of the western parts of the Black Sea. That allowed seaborne grain exportsto return to near-prewar levels. What may happen next? Last week, in a phone conversation with President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia agreed to halt attacks against Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days. Ukraine, which has been in favor of a full immediate cease-fire, followed suit. Both countries have reaffirmed their commitment to institute a 30-day moratorium on energy strikes. On Tuesday, the Kremlin listed facilities that fall under the moratorium. That includes refineries, pipelines and storage facilities, nuclear plants, hydroelectric dams and energy transmission infrastructure. But it seemingly excluded gas and oil extraction sites — facilities that Ukraine says have been increasingly attacked by Russia recently and that Kyivincludedin its own cease-fire list. The energy cease-fire situation, experts say, highlights how Moscow portrays itself as open to negotiations without making major concessions. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s defense minister,said Tuesdaythat “additional technical consultations” were needed to effectively carry out the energy and maritime agreements.

A Fire Plunged Heathrow Into Darkness. A Nearby Data Center Kept Humming. Why?,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/heathrow-fire-power-outage-explained.html,2025-03-26T10:16:15Z,World,It could cost $100 million and take years to install the backup generators to prevent another hourslong power loss like the one at Britain’s biggest airport last week.,Airports; Power Failures and Blackouts; Fires and Firefighters; Data Centers; Energy and Power,"Starmer, Keir",Great Britain,"Heathrow Airport (London, England)","A fire at an electrical substation near Heathrow on Friday forced a power outage at the airport. It took officials close to 18 hours to bring its terminals and runways back into operation. Michael D. Shear reported from London and Ivan Penn from Los Angeles. A Fire Plunged Heathrow Into Darkness. A Nearby Data Center Kept Humming. Why? It could cost $100 million and take years to install the backup generators to prevent another hourslong power loss like the one at Britain’s biggest airport last week. A gleaming new data center sits less than half a mile from the electric substation where a fire plunged Heathrow Airport into darkness last week. The data center’s own power was also cut that day. But no one who relied on it would have noticed, thanks to a bank of batteries and backup generators designed to kick in instantly. Meanwhile it took officials at Europe’s busiest airport close to 18 hours to bring its terminals and runways back into operation,causing global travel delaysand underscoring the vulnerability of Britain’s infrastructure. It is a striking contrast that energy experts say can be explained largely by one word: Money. “The data center industry is relatively young. They are more attuned to the cost of a catastrophic failure,” said Simon Gallagher, the managing director at UK Networks Services, which advises clients on the resilience of their electricity networks. He said most of the world’s airports — including Heathrow — have not been willing to make the big investments necessary to build total backup systems. Even at an airport the size of Heathrow, which officials have described as equivalent in power use to a small city, it is possible to create backup systems robust enough to maintain normal operations during a catastrophic power failure, Mr. Gallagher and other engineering experts said. But it could cost as much as $100 million and would likely take years to put in place. So far, most airports have chosen not to make the investment. “It comes down to a cost-benefit analysis,” Mr. Gallagher said. “At the minute, there seems to be an assumption that it would cost too much.”The AirportHeathrow officials were quick to point out after Friday’s incident that the airport has backup power in place for its most critical systems: runway lights and the tower’s traffic control safety systems. If a plane had needed to land that day, it could have done so safely. But the airport had no way to power the rest of the sprawling and complicated facility: the vast terminals, filled with shops and restaurants, moving walkways and escalators. Cut from the grid, there was no power to move bags to the claim area, or for ticket counters or bathrooms. An eerily empty Terminal 4 at Heathrow on Friday. Engineers at the airport had to manually reconfigure switches at another substation to temporarily reroute available power to Heathrow. That took hours. First opened at the end of World War II, Heathrow has been expanded and updated over the decades. The result has been a patchwork of older and newer electrical cables and systems carrying an ever-increasing demand for power. “The grid is old,” said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California. “For aviation, for the grid and for other safety critical systems, the older that they get the more important maintenance becomes.”What Heathrow does not have are backup generators that could supply the 40 megawatts of power required at peak times to maintain normal operations. Instead, on Friday, engineers at the airport had to manually reconfigure switches at another substation to temporarily reroute available power to Heathrow. That took hours, and because the airport’s systems had been sitting without power, it took even more time to boot them back up, followed by rounds of testing. The SubstationThe airport’s primary power source is the Hyde North substation about a mile away, owned and operated by National Grid Electricity Transmission, the private power company responsible for the area. Two of the substation’s transformers were taken offline by the fire. The cause is still under investigation, but the police said Tuesday they had found “no evidence” of suspicious activity. John Pettigrew, the chief executive of National Grid, told The Financial Times that there was “no lack of capacity” in the area after the fire. Energy experts said that is correct: The places where there is an actual lack of power tend to be developing countries and war zones. The fire also affected electrical supply at a nearby data center. But sophisticated sensors detected the loss of power and shifted to batteries and then generators. The challenge, though, was making use of the area’s ample power once Heathrow’s connection to Hyde North was severed. Thomas Woldbye, the chief executive of the airport, told the BBC that he was proud of the employees who worked through Friday to switch their systems to use power from two nearby substations. But he said that Heathrow would now assess whether to install “a different level of resilience if we cannot trust that the grid around us is working the way it should.” Heathrow did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The Data CenterThe airport’s leaders might want to examine their corporate neighbor just to the north. The Union Park data facility, run by Ark Data Centres, is a six-minute walk from the Hyde North substation. Inside, computers run 24 hours a day, powering the cloud services and artificial intelligence that are at the heart of modern banking, commerce, research and government operations. Huw Owen, the company’s chief executive, said its electrical supply was interrupted when the fire broke out. But sophisticated sensors detected the loss of power and instantly shifted to batteries that operate much like an uninterruptible power supply system for a personal computer. That gave the facility’s generators time to spin up, and they soon took over. “It’s a well-rehearsed, well-known process,” Mr. Owen said in an interview. “It’s this mind-set that resilience and keeping everything powered is absolutely front and center of our world.” Mr. Owen said the company installed the costly generator backup system despite expectations it might never be needed. Apermitting applicationprepared for the company in December described the possibility of a power outage as “extremely rare.”“It would require a catastrophic regional failure on the grid, or at the supplying power station, and would likely impact not only the site but the surrounding London area,” the summary notes. “As a result, the grid connection is considered to be highly reliable as demonstrated in the grid reliability letter provided with the application (calculated as 99.999605%).”The DecisionPrime Minister Keir Starmertold the BBCafter the fire, “I don’t want to see an airport as important as Heathrow going down in the way it did on Friday.”But how to avoid it in the future? The challenge in making electrical upgrades to places like Heathrow is determining how to pay for it when high energy costs are straining consumer budgets. In the past, airport investment has often been passed on to customers in the form of higher ticket prices on airlines. Mr. Gallagher, the consultant on electrical network resilience, noted that new airports in places like Dubai were built with the kind of backups that could keep terminals open. And a few older airports, like Schiphol in Amsterdam, have upgraded their facilities with large generators. But if Heathrow’s management wants to follow suit, experts say, they will need to accept that it requires a large investment to prevent a crisis that may not happen again for many years. “It’s a hell of a lot easier to build it from Day 1 than it is to try and retrofit stuff,” Mr. Owen said of Heathrow and other old airports. “They are as capable of instigating resilience at those sites as I am, but they’re now going to have to retrofit, whereas I built it from Day 1.”The runway at Heathrow was deserted after the fire shut the airport down. The challenge in making large scale electrical upgrades at a decades-old airport is determining how to pay for it.

World’s Largest ‘Baby Exporter’ Admits to Adoption Fraud,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/asia/south-korea-adoption-fraud.html,2025-03-26T10:12:57Z,World,A South Korean truth commission called for the country to apologize to those who were sent abroad “like luggage” so that adoption agencies could profit.,Adoptions; Corruption (Institutional); Politics and Government; Babies and Infants,,South Korea,,"Sun-young Park, the chairwoman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, comforts an adoptee, Yooree Kim, on Wednesday after delivering the findings of the agency’s investigation into South Korea’s decades of adoption malpractices. Reporting from SeoulWorld’s Largest ‘Baby Exporter’ Admits to Adoption FraudA South Korean truth commission called for the country to apologize to those who were sent abroad “like luggage” so that adoption agencies could profit. South Korea on Wednesday admitted for the first time that in its rush to send children to American and European homes decades ago, its adoption agencies committed widespread malpractices, including falsifying documents​, to make them more adoptable​. The findings by South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government agency,​ which said children were sent away “like luggage” for profit decades ago, were a hard-won victory for South Korean adoptees abroad. Many adoptees have returned to their birth country in recent years, campaigning tirelessly for South Korea to come to terms with one of the most shameful legacies of its modern history. Adoption agencies falsified documents to present babies as orphans when they had known parents, the commission acknowledged. When some babies died before they were flown overseas, other babies were sent in their names. The heads of ​four private adoption agencies were given the power to become legal guardians for ​the children, signing them away for ​overseas adoption. The commission’s report was the government’s first official admission of problems with​ the country’s adoption practices, including the lack of oversight, even though such malpractice had beenexposedin the past. The agency recommended that ​the state apologize for violating the rights​ of South Korean adoptees. South Korea is the source of the world’s largest diaspora of intercountry adoptees, with around 200,000 ​South Korean children sent abroad since the end of the Korean War in 1953, mostly to the United States and Europe. In ​its destitute postwar decades, South Korea promoted overseas adoptions to find homes for orphaned, abandoned or disabled children abroad rather than build a welfare system for them at home. The government left it to ​the adoption agencies to find and ship children abroad for fees from adoptive families. “Numerous legal and policy shortcomings emerged,” said Sun-young Park, the chairwoman of the commission. “These violations should never have occurred.”The findings carry repercussions beyond South Korea, as several receiving countries — ​including Norway and Denmark​ — have opened investigations into their international adoptions. The United States, which has received more children from South Korea than any other country, has not done so.​“This is a moment we have fought to achieve: the commission’s decision acknowledges what we adoptees have known for so long — that the deceit, fraud, and issues within the Korean adoption process cannot remain hidden,” said Peter Moller, a South Korean adoptee from Denmark who led an international campaign for the commission to launch an investigation. Peter Moller, left, with other co-founders of a Danish group that fought for an investigation into South Korea’s adoption practices. The commission identified many cases where the identities and family information of children were “lost, falsified or fabricated” and where children were sent abroad without legal consent. It cited the case of a baby girl it identified only by her last name, Chang, who was born in Seoul in 1974. Her adoption agency in Seoul knew her mother’s identity. But in the documents it sent to her adoptive family in Denmark, the agency said the girl came from an orphanage. That agency, Korea Social Service, charged a $1,500 adoption fee, as well as a $400 donation, per child from adoptive families in 1988, the commission said. (South Korea’s per-capita national income that year was $4,571.) Some of these funds were in turn used to secure more children, turning intercountry adoptions into “a profit-driven industry,” the commission said. South Korea’s export of babies peaked in the 1980s, with as many as 8,837 children shipped abroad in 1985. Children were “sent abroad like luggage,” the commission said, presenting a photo that showed rows of infants and young children strapped to airplane seats​. “While this is not news to us adoptees, it is a significant victory in the sense that we are finally receiving acknowledgment of what has happened to us over the years​,” said Anja Pedersen, ​who was sent to Denmark in 1976​ under the name of another girl, who had died while waiting for adoption. The ​truth commission does not have the power to prosecute any of the adoption agencies, but the government is required by law to follow its recommendations.​​The adoption agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the commission launched its investigation​ in late 2022, some 367 overseas adoptees have asked it to investigate their cases, a majority of them from Denmark.​ On Wednesday, the commission recognized 56 of them as victims of human rights violations. It was still investigating the other cases. Mia Lee Sorensen, a South Korean adoptee who was sent to Denmark in 1987, said the commission’s findings provided the “validation” that she had been seeking. When she found her birth parents in South Korea in 2022, they couldn’t believe she was alive. They told her that her mother had passed out during labor and that when she woke up, the clinic told her that the baby had died. Those whose cases weren’t recognized among the victims on Wednesday expressed hope that the commission would be extended to carry out more investigations. Mary Bowers, who was adopted by a family in Colorado​ in 1982, was still waiting for answers ​to many inconsistencies in her adoption papers. “This is only the beginning,” Ms. Bowers said.

"Europe Talks Tough on Military Spending, but Unity Is Fracturing",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/ukraine-us-nato-eu-defense.html,2025-03-26T09:05:51Z,World,European leaders are struggling to find the money and the political will to replace the bulk of the U.S. contribution to Ukraine and to their own defense.,United States International Relations; Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022),"Trump, Donald J; Kallas, Kaja (1977- ); von der Leyen, Ursula; Macron, Emmanuel (1977- ); Vance, J D",Europe; Russia; Ukraine; United States,European Union; North Atlantic Treaty Organization,"Ursula von der Leyen, center right, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark at the Royal Danish Military Academy in Copenhagen this month. Steven Erlanger reported from Berlin, and Jeanna Smialek from Brussels. Europe Talks Tough on Military Spending, but Unity Is FracturingNews AnalysisEuropean leaders are struggling to find the money and the political will to replace the bulk of the U.S. contribution to Ukraine and to their own defense. European leaders have gotten the message from Washington about doing more for their own defense and for Ukraine, too. They are talking tough when it comes to supporting Ukraine and about protecting their own borders, and they are standing up to a demanding and even hostile Trump administration. But there is an inevitable gap between talk and action, and unity is fracturing already, especially when it comes to spending and borrowing money in a period of low growth and high debt. The Dutch and others are not fans of raising collective debt for defense. Keeping Hungary on board is ever more difficult. And when the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced a plan for billions more for the military, called “ReArm Europe,” two of the bloc’s largest countries, Italy and Spain, thought that was all a bit aggressive. So now the plan has been rebranded as “Readiness 2030.”That’s a year after Donald J. Trump is no longer expected to be president. But it is also a realistic understanding that Europe’s new commitment to self-reliance will take time, billions of euros, political deftness and cooperation with the United States. Kaja Kallas, former prime minister of Estonia and chief foreign and security official for the European Union, has pushed for supporting Ukraine as a first line of European defense against Russia. Kaja Kallas, the former prime minister of Estonia who is now the chief foreign and security official for the European Union, has been a forceful advocate for supporting Ukraine as a first line of European defense against an aggressive, militarized Russia. But it has been a rocky start for Ms. Kallas. Her effort to get the E.U. to provide up to 40 billion euros (more than $43 billion) to Ukraine through a small, fixed percentage levy on each country’s national income has gone nowhere. Her backup proposal, for an added €5 billion as a first step toward providing Ukraine two million artillery shells this year, was also rejected by Italy, Slovakia and even France, an E.U. official said, speaking anonymously in accordance with diplomatic practice. The countries insisted that contributions to Ukraine remain voluntary, bilateral and not required by Brussels. And her recent response to Mr. Trump’s effort to push Ukraine into a cease-fire without security assurances rubbed many the wrong way, both in Europe and Washington, as dangerously premature. “The free world needs a new leader,” shewrote on X. “It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”But in fact the Europeans are working hard to respond to Mr. Trump in a convincing fashion. Ms. von der Leyen sold her rearmament or readiness plan with a headline figure of €800 billion. But only €150 billion of that is real money, available as long-term loans for countries that wish to use it for the military. The rest simply represents a notional figure — a four-year permission from the bloc for countries to borrow even more for military purposes out of their own national budgets. For a country like Germany, which has low debt, that is likely to work, especially now that the next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, got Parliament to agreeto loosen its own debt rulesto allow for huge spending on the military, civilian infrastructure and climate. But for countries like Italy and Spain, which can feel far away from Russia and have their own fiscal problems, that may not be an easy choice. France, despite President Emmanuel Macron’s strong words about European “strategic autonomy” and his desire to lead the Continent, is itself deeply indebted, and piling on more debt is politically and economically hazardous. For countries like Italy and Spain, permission from the bloc to borrow even more for military purposes may not be an easy choice. France, too,is insistingon a highpercentage of European content and manufacturefor any weapons bought with the new loans, and is so far working to keep American, British and Canadian companies from participating. And other issues are intruding; an E.U. effort to draft a defense agreement with Britain is being held up by Paris over squabbles about fisheries. But Europe will spend considerably more on defense, as it has known it must, said Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund. “The advent of the Trump administration has given history a shove,” he said. “We’re not in a linear environment, with a linear spending trajectory.”On NATO, too, major European countries are beginning to talk seriously about how to replace the vital American role in the alliance — both in terms of sophisticated arms and political and military leadership. But there is little desire to accelerate any rupture with Washington, since any such transition is likely to take five or even 10 years. Now, 23 of 27 E.U. states are also NATO members, including about 95 percent of E.U. citizens, and NATO has its own requirements for new military spending. European states are discussing what they can propose to Mr. Trump at the next NATO summit in June, in The Hague, that will ensure American cooperation in any transition. But while Trump officials have privately reassured Europeans that the U.S. president supports NATO, will retain the American nuclear umbrella over Europe and remains committed to collective defense, Mr. Trump’s views are famously changeable, and he persists in viewing NATO as a club where members pay for American protection. Ukrainian combat medics from the Azov Brigade undergoing training in how to do blood transfusions in Donetsk in March. In his first term, he often mused about leaving NATO while saying the United States will defend only countries that pay enough for defense. This month,he repeatedthat warning. He has demanded that NATO members pay up to 5 percent of gross domestic product on defense, significantly more than the United States, which spends about 3.4 percent of G.D.P. on its global military. NATO officials want to set a new spending goal at the summit in June, but one closer to 3.5 percent of G.D.P., up from 2 percent now. In response, Sweden’s center-right government announced plans on Wednesday to increase defense spending to 3.5 percent of G.D.P. by 2030, an ambitious goal. Sweden is currently projected to spend 2.4 percent this year. Reinforcing concerns in Europe that the United States may no longer be a reliable partner was the extraordinary discussion among top Trump administration officials of the American strike on Yemen, revealed by Jeffrey Goldbergin The Atlantic,who was inadvertently added to the group chat on the messaging app Signal. The discussion was replete with comments like this one from Vice President JD Vance: “I just hate bailing out the Europeans again.” And there were boastful messages about finding a way to get Europe to pay for the operation — but nothing about China, which benefits hugely from the trade passing through the straits near Yemen, including much of its oil imports and its exports to Europe. Mr. Trump’s sudden suggestion last week that a future American fighter plane might be sold to alliesin a downgraded versionhas also reinforced these concerns. Prompted by Mr. Trump’s stated intention to leave Ukraine’s defense to Europe, Britain and France are working on a proposal for a European “reassurance force” to be on the ground in Ukraine once a peace settlement is reached between Kyiv and Moscow, if one ever is. But so far, no other E.U. country has publicly volunteered to serve in such a force, which is largely undefined and unfinanced, and which Russia has consistently rejected. After meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Paris on Wednesday evening, Mr. Macron said that Europe would remain steadfast in its commitment to Ukraine and announced France would provide the country 2 billion euros in military aid. Mr. Macron described the funds as “additional,” though it is unclear if the figure included already announced aid. The meeting between Mr. Macron and Mr. Zelensky came ahead of a broader “coalition of the willing” gathering in Paris on Thursday, mostly including nearly 30 European heads of state and government. Mr. Macron said that any European reassurance force would be discussed, but he reiterated that it would not be on the front lines of the conflict and would not be tasked with monitoring or enforcing a cease-fire — a job that he suggested could fall to United Nations peacekeepers. Instead, he said, a reassurance force of European troops would be based further within Ukraine to deter Russia and help train and support Ukrainian forces. But Mr. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff,called the idea“simplistic” and “a posture and a pose.”Efforts at creating a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine continued, with the announcement on Tuesday that the two countries had agreed to stop attacks on ships in the Black Sea. But even that agreement was subject to a Russian demand that Western countries drop restrictions on Russian agricultural exports. Ms. von der Leyen talks of making Ukraine “a steel porcupine,” too difficult for Russia to swallow in the future, an echo of anearly planfor Ukrainian defense drafted by a former NATO secretary general, Anders Rasmussen. But even a steel porcupine is not a security guarantee, and it implies an endless commitment to supporting Ukraine. Prime Minister Bart De Wever of Belgium summed up the European problem nicely last week. He praised Mr. Macron for drumming up a “coalition of the willing” to boost military aid for Ukraine as U.S. support dwindles. But he said he had pleaded for a bit more structure in the group. “We are willing — but willing to do what, exactly?” he asked.

A Traditional Ramadan Treat Gets a Modern Remake (but Good Luck Getting It),https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/middleeast/syria-ramadan-food-marook.html,2025-03-26T09:01:12Z,World,"Marook, a sweet bread eaten during Ramadan in Syria, used to be a simple loaf, but now the list of choices can be as long as the lines of customers.",Bread; Ramadan; Bakeries and Baked Products; War and Armed Conflicts,,Syria; Damascus (Syria),," Reporting from Damascus, Syria. A Traditional Ramadan Treat Gets a Modern Remake (but Good Luck Getting It)Al Jouzeh, in Damascus, Syria, is spread over three shops that bake thousands of loaves in different shapes, sizes and flavors. Marook, a sweet bread eaten during Ramadan in Syria, used to be a simple loaf, but now the list of choices can be as long as the lines of customers. As the minutes ticked closer to sundown, the crowd grew more impatient, pressing against the glass display case, shouting and shoving bills toward the young men filling order after order of the Ramadan sweet bread. “If you please—”What is this stuffed with? Sir, take my money! Just be patient!”The high-pressure volley of queries, entreaties and pleas for patience plays out each evening of Ramadan as Syrians jostle for marook, a sweet bread eaten here during the Muslim fasting month. As the time of iftar, the breaking of the fast, nears, a day’s worth of hunger pangs combine with jockeying among patrons desperate to get their marook loaves and rush home before the call to prayer sounds from mosque minarets. There is a hint of tension in the air, but much more pronounced is the smell of baked bread, sugar and chocolate. Marook, a simple sweetened bread sprinkled with sesame seeds, has been a part of Syrian Ramadan traditions for generations. Each year, as bakeries — and the occasional pizza parlor — devote their entire production to it during Ramadan, new variations emerge to satiate evolving tastes. Syrians are proud of their rich culinary traditions, but not precious about allowing them to evolve. There are now olives in the fattoush salad. Onions in the shawarma. Parsley in the hummus. And then there is marook, which comes in so many different iterations that bakeries post long lists of all their offerings, some unrecognizable from the original. Perhaps unavoidably given the viral food trend, aDubai chocolatemarook appeared in some shops this year. Prices differ from bakery to bakery. Individual loaves often cost around 4,000 Syrian pounds, less than 50 cents, while large ones — depending on how fancy they are — can go up to 45,000 pounds. “The older people like the classic for sure,” said Tareq al-Abyad, the owner of one bakery, Al Jouzeh, standing between racks stacked with trays of marook. “I even get surprised by the new ones. For me, I only like the plain one. But I don’t sell only what I like, I have to sell what the customers want.”Many bakeries devote their entire production during Ramadan to marook. On the other side of the glass counter his customers stood on the sidewalk calling out their orders above the honking in the street behind them. Occasionally they had to dodge a bicycle or motorcycle racing onto the sidewalk to avoid the bumper-to-bumper traffic on the road as everyone rushed to make it home in time for iftar. “Please, is there pistachio bubbly?” asked Ayah al-Homsi, 27, referring to a marook that comes in a honeycomb shape and is drizzled with pistachio cream. The bakery was already out of that flavor. She got an Oreo-filled one instead. “The first night we always eat plain, date-filled and coconut,” said Ms. al-Homsi, a Damascus native, of her family’s Ramadan eating habits. “And then we start trying the other flavors.”Seemingly overwhelmed by the choices, a couple and their young daughter stood debating each flavor before walking off without any marook. At Al Jouzeh, baking begins at 6 a.m. The bakers eat suhoor, the predawn meal before the fast, at home, then arrive for an exhausting day of kneading, stuffing, glazing and sprinkling. They work like a well-oiled assembly line. Little is said except for the occasional urging from one worker, Mahmoud Midani, 39, to pick up the pace. “Let’s go — move this tray,” he ordered Muhammad Taboosh each time another tray was filled. Mr. Taboosh, 16, was nearly covered in flour. The bakery runs off a mix of solar energy, a diesel-powered generator and two hours a day of government-provided electricity. Syria’s power grid is marked by long blackouts, a result of the 13-year civil war. Mohammad Hilwan, 20, from the Old City in Damascus, has been working at the bakery for more than a year. “This is part of our Syrian heritage and goes back many many generations,” he said. “This variety, we are changing with the times. It’s not something bad — on the contrary, this is modernization.”One by one he took a small marook loaf from a tray and filled it with melted white chocolate using an automatic nozzle before drizzling more on top and adding a sprinkle of crumbled chocolate cookie. It is his favorite flavor. “The plain ones our grandfathers used to eat,” he said. As the time nears to break the day’s fast, eager crowds form to buy bread. The bakery has three locations, and between them they make about 11,000 large and small marook loaves each day, Mr. al-Abyad said. Those thousands of loaves disappear quickly in the last hour of the day’s fast, and customers seeking specific flavors may walk away empty-handed. “My dear, just one with dates,” said Salih Muhammad, 41, as he stuck his head behind the counter trying to maneuver past the crowd. “There are no more date ones, uncle,” 17-year-old Muhammad Khawla told him — and then reiterated this for his co-workers. “Guys,” he said, “there are no more date ones.”“Oh no, what will I do?” Mr. Muhammad asked himself despondently. In his hand he held a bag from another bakery with three small marooks, a plain one for him and coconut ones for his two young children. His wife had requested a date marook, and less than half an hour before iftar he was going from bakery to bakery in search of one. By then the varieties in bakeries across the city had thinned out. “We don’t know exactly what’s still left,” said Mr. Khawla, wearing an orange sweatshirt with a Syrian map and the date and time marking the fall of the Assad regime in December. By that point the sweatshirt was smeared with their many flavors on offer: chocolate, pistachio and Biscoff. Amid the flurry of business, the young men behind the counter didn’t always have time to count all the Syrian bills they were being handed by customers. Currency depreciation over the course of the war has meant that even small everyday purchases can require a thick stack of bills. With only minutes remaining before iftar, seconds can matter, and some customers did not bother waiting for their change. Mr. Khawla handed over an order of five coconut marooks, five Biscoff-flavored ones and a bubbly to a regular customer, an older man, and stepped away to get his change. When he turned back, holding out a stack of 1,000 Syrian notes, he scanned the thinning crowd for him in vain. “Where’s the hajji?” asked Mr. Khawla, using an honorific for older people. Then he laughed. “The hajji has rushed home,” he said. The customers’ preferences are as varied as the bread itself.

South Korea Battles Its Worst Wildfires on RecordAt least 26 people are dead, including the pilot of a helicopter that crashed trying to contain blazes that strong winds and dry conditions were helping to spread rapidly. At least 26 people have died in the worst wildfires on record in South Korea, massive infernos that have spread quickly over the past week, consuming hundreds of structures including two ancient Buddhist temples, officials said. The Interior Ministry gave the updated death toll in a report issued Thursday morning local time. It also said the blazes, which began last Friday, had scorched or were still burning across 88,000 acres of land in the country’s southeastern region — double the figure from the previous day. The largest blaze previously was in 2000, when fires blazed across 59,000 acres, killing two people, according to government archives. Flames and smoke have damaged 317 buildings across the region, according to the ministry. That includes the two temples, each more than 1,000 years old. Videos from local newsstations showed the inferno surrounding and then closing in on them. The Korea Heritage Service said via social media on Wednesday that some treasures from one, the Gounsa temple, including a stone Buddha statue, had been removed before the fire reached it.

Out of nearly 30 blazes since Friday, five were still burning early Thursday, including the largest, which covered some 82,000 acres. The government said that firefighters had contained 44 percent of that blaze, but windy conditions have prevented them from mobilizing helicopters and drones. The nation’s weather agency forecast small amounts of rain in the region by the end of the week, but officials said they doubted it would do much to help put out the flames. The fires appeared to be “breaking the record for the worst wildfires ever,” said acting President Han Duck-soo, who just this week wasreinstatedafter being impeached in December.
